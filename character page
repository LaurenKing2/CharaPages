          <p>I'm Lauren King! I'm 23, female, AroAce and a Type 1 diabetic.</p>
          <p>I can be a little scatter-brained and lazy, but I always try my best to be friendly to everyone! Please reach out to me if you want to! Unfortunately due to that fun anxiety/depression cocktail I'm not likely to make the first move, haha. But rest assured I love speaking to people, especially if we're yelling about our muses!</p>
          <p>My Discord ID is <b>lking22#4506</b>. Add me if you want to talk about anything at all!</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Rules</div>
          <h1>OOC-Related Rules</h1>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Separate Mun and Muse</b> (even if your muse is a self-insert). I can be cruel to fictional characters, but I would never want to inflict half of this stuff on a real person.</li>
            <li><b>Be polite OOC.</b> Characters are allowed to be rude to each other, but Muns should be friends!</li>
            <li><b>OOC</b> anti-LGBTQIA+, racism, transphobia, or other <b>hate speech not allowed</b>. If you think like that, don’t even bother following me on any account. That being said, I also know that writing a problematic character =/= having problematic beliefs. In character explorations of these topics are fine, as long as they aren’t favorable towards bigotry.</li>
            <li>Please <b>tag realistic pictures of spiders</b>.</li>
            <li><b>If you need something tagged, let me know!</b> I try to tag general triggers the best I can, but I am happy to add specific ones.</li>
          </ol>
          <h1>RP-Related Rules</h1>
          <ol>
            <li><b>No godmodding</b>, auto-hitting, or deciding my character’s feelings for them. You can say what you attempt to do, and then I will decide if it works versus my character. I will extend the same courtesy to you and your characters, and hope that we can fairly and realistically decide what works and what doesn’t. (This rule is flexible for people with mind control powers, but I would prefer to talk about that ooc first.)</li>
            <li><b>Open to OCs, crossovers, and fandomless muses.</b> No need to send a password or wait for me to follow you, <b>interact as you please!</b></li>
            <li><b>I am multiverse/multiship</b>, but will have a main ‘canon’ that will be added to and expanded in the ‘Relationships’ page and bio as things progress. I’ll pick and choose canon events after a thread is finished.<br><b>I do have mains, but not exclusives.</b> Mains are the versions of the character that I will default to talking about in asks that are not specifically related to another version.</li>
            <li><b>Consider these RPs R-rated.</b> Swearing, violence (up to and including torture), and sexual content should be expected while reading. It’s not all I post, but it will be there.</li>
            <li>That being said, <b>if you want to RP smut, please ask first!</b> Being ace, I’m not up for it often. Also, no smut with minors. 18+ only for that. All smut must be under a readmore, and I'm generally more comfortable moving to Discord entirely for content of that nature.<br>Due to my own inexperience, I'm only really comfortable with foreplay and sexual situations, not actual sex. I just don't know how to write anything once genitals get involved.</li>
            <li>Occasionally something happens that makes me temporarily lose muse for a thread. If that happens, <b>please wait 48 hours before asking me if I'm going to reply!</b> Rest assured I probably have our thread open in another tab and I'm already guilting myself about not replying. Also, I recently got a job, so there may be times when I'm at work or too tired from work to do anything. I'm planning to be around mostly on the weekends from now on.</li>
            <li><b>When I’m finished an interaction, I always ‘like’ the post.</b> Think of it as me putting a fullstop on the RP. That way it’s easy to tell if I have or haven’t seen a reply. You don’t have to do the same for me if you don’t want to clog up your likes (or any other reason).</li>
            <li><b>I’m also fine with having multiple threads with the same person and putting a thread on hold to come back to it later.</b></li>
            <li><b>I have pretty bad social anxiety, and as such find it hard to reach out/make the first move.</b> As such, I don’t usually do ‘greeter’ posts for new followers, because I feel like those will be a bother. However, each blog has at least one starter call that can be liked at any time!</li>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>The default AU. Moderately canon compliant and up to date with the events of the anime's dub. May lag behind an episode or two if the mun falls behind watching new episodes. May occasionally include references to / foreshadowing of manga spoilers the mun has heard about.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Despite being described (by himself and others) as a 'crybaby', Izuku is a hard working and dependable person. No matter what situation arises, he will always want to know what he can do to make things better for the people around him.</p>
              <p>Determined and self-sacrificial to a fault, it's not unusual for him to work himself half to death in the pursuit of his goals (that being his dream of being a hero and his almost pathological desire to keep people safe).</p>
              <p>While he is generally a very forgiving person, and tries his best to practice keeping a positive attitude, he does not have unlimited patience for certain things. Seeing the strong hurting the weak instead of defending them, hearing slanderous words about his friends, and anything even bordering on abuse are sure-fire ways to get him enraged.</p>
              <p>Still, that rage isn't infinite, either. He doesn't tend to hold grudges, and what few he does hold he can put aside for the sake of being polite or keeping a team working together.</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Quirk</div>
          <h1>One for All</h1>
          <p>Stockpiles raw power for later use, resulting in amazing feats of strength, speed, and agility. The power can be used through his whole body, or can be focused into a single body part. He can (and should) limit the amount of power used at any given time. Using more power than his body can handle results in strain or massive injuries. Currently, he can continuously use 8% of One for All, and can briefly boost his power output to 20% without serious injuries.</p>
          <p>One for All can be transferred to another person through ingesting the DNA of the current user.</p>
          <p>Each time it is transferred, One for All also stockpiles the quirks of the previous wielder and adds it to the 'core' of One for All, allowing the next user to wield it alongside the stockpiling quirk. Quirks within One for All that Izuku currently has access to are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Blackwhip</b> - <i>The fifth user's quirk.</i><br>Creates tendrils of dark energy for grappling and increased mobility.</li>

            <li>Izuku is formally diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>He used to stim, but forced himself to suppress that during middle school due to bullying.</li>
              <li>His ASD is one of the few things Katsuki never specifically targeted him for, although he didn't know some of the things he picked on were part of Izuku's ASD.</li>
              <li>By this point, he has mostly replaced his old stims with exercise. Small weights and his hand grips are his favourite equipment.</li>
              <li>While he's comfortable talking about it, he still needs to work on fully accepting it due to the bullying in his past.</li>
              <li>Sharp  snapping/popping sounds near his left ear help to ground and/or focus him.</li>
              <li>Putting pressure on his chest (or his back, if his chest is unavailable) helps calm him.</li>
              <li>Katsuki is one of the few people (besides his and Izuku's parents) that know much about Izuku's ASD, as well as how to calm him down when he starts to get worked up enough to get close to a meltdown.</li>
              <li>All of the blankets that Izuku owns are weighted blankets (unless they are fandom merch but he doesn't use those).</li>
              <li>He doesn't often make eye contact, unless he very seriously wants to get a point across (and even then he has to force himself to do it).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Izuku has generalized and social anxiety, which he is now taking anti-anxiety medication for.</li>
            <li>Izuku is hyper-empathetic.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Seeing people in severe emotional distress or seeing people get injured can cause him real, physical pain.</li>
              <li>He tends to mirror peoples' feelings easily. This is how he often knows exactly what Katsuki is trying to express during angry outbursts.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Izuku believes firmly in the positive power of therapy, and encourages his friends to go. He, however, often forgets that he needs therapy, too.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>While he did go as a child, the therapy was mostly focused on his ASD and teaching him how to socialize. He didn't enjoy it much, but recognises that isn't everyone's experience with it.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Izuku always signs off text conversations with friends by reminding them to take care of themselves. For example, 'Get a good amount of sleep tonight!' or 'Remember to drink water!'</li>
            <li>Oddly strong alcohol tolerance runs in Izuku's family, and he is no exception.</li>
            <li>Izuku knows what Katsuki tastes like, since he bit him during a fight when they were kids. Later, when writing about Katsuki's quirk, he did another taste-test.</li>
            <li>Before permanently damaging his right arm, Izuku used to be ambidextrous. His left hand is now slightly more precise than his right. Although since he was mostly taught to do things in a right-handed way as a kid, he defaults to that out of habit unless he needs to be especially precise.</li>
            <li>Because he could tell that Katsuki was losing his hearing from his own explosions quite early in life, Izuku set aside time during primary and middle school to learn JSL.</li>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>After All Might told him that he couldn't be a hero and left him alone on a rooftop, Izuku decided to take the advice of his old friend-turned-tormentor and take a 'swan dive' off the roof. He was seen and rescued, but not before he hit the ground.</p>
              <p>Once he was discharged from hospital, he quit middle school before he could graduate (under the guise of a break). His mother, not wanting him to mope around the house all day, got him a part-time job at a convenience store. That store was soon robbed by Gentle Criminal, whose creative quirk use inspired Izuku once again. He tracked down Gentle using information gathered from his videos and begged to be allowed to join him and La Brava. However, he had two goals outside of that: to use his new villainy to inspire Katsuki to become a better hero (thinking that all he needed was a good rival to fight against), and to get revenge on All Might for abandoning him that day.</p>
              <p><b>Sub-AU: <a href="https://ooh-ouch-me-bones.tumblr.com/tagged/Swan%20Dive%3B%3B%20Fledgling">Fledgling</a></b></p>
              <p>Determined to get strong enough to do so (and encouraged by <a href="https://kibouhero.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" title="kibouhero">an alternate Deku</a>), he pushed himself into murdering one of his old bullies from middle school.</p>
              <p>He wasn't ready, though. The murder shook him, making him unable to function. He is currently avoiding his family and the villains who took him in. Everyone is getting worried about him. Meanwhile, Katsuki found that bully's death suspicious, and is starting to close in on his old victim.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Often quiet and contemplative, Izuku finds it hard to drag himself out of his usual depression. He tries to make himself small, in almost any situation. The exception is when he is caught doing something villainous. When that happens, he emulates Gentle's more exaggerated mannerisms in an effort to play the perfect villain.</p>
              <p><b>Sub-AU: <a href="https://ooh-ouch-me-bones.tumblr.com/tagged/Swan%20Dive%3B%3B%20Fledgling">Fledgling</a></b></p>
              <p>After the murder, Izuku's personality is severely fragmented, due to how much he compartmentalizes and tries desperately to cling to any form of stability. He does not have DID, but he does have 'phases' that he goes through.</p>
              <p>His most common phase is nervous and self-depreciating. He is paranoid, and for good reason, considering the amount of enemies he makes. He's also very easily adgitated, and often throws violent fits where he will try to remove whatever is upsetting him by force (whether that requires murder or not is variable).</p>
              <p>However, when encouraged by <a href="https://kibouhero.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" title="kibouhero">the alternate Deku</a>, he can become sadistic and joyful, riding high on the feeling of power and control that harming others gives him. His joy is twisted up with pain and self-hatred at this point, so he cannot feel one without the other. Besides that, this phase is a form of self-defense against his own crumbling psyche.</p>
              <p>His other phase only happens around Katsuki, where he becomes serene, loving, and focused on his goal of becoming the perfect villain to force Katsuki to be the perfect hero. His 'villain act' returns in these cases.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>As a young child in a small village, Izuku Midoriya always looked up to heroes and adventurers. Unfortunately, he was born with no class, only the word NULL in its place. This left him completely without a spell list or MP. Even martial classes need to use MP in order to cast buffs and defensive spells. Hell, even random villagers use MP in their day-to-day tasks. Without it, no-one thought he could achieve his dream.</p>
              <p>However, one night he witnessed a battle between the great Paladin All Might and the Dark Wizard All for One. Izuku, though terrified, distracted the Dark Wizard long enough for the Paladin to drive him back. Both combatants were gravely injured, though All for One was thankfully driven back.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, All Might would nor survive the battle. However, he was sure that the child who was brave enough to put himself at risk of attack to help was worthy of inheriting his sword, and thus the power of One for All. As a previous holder of the sword, Toshinori’s spirit still resides inside it, and will occasionally emerge to give Izuku advice and encouragement. Unfortunately, without MP, Izuku is forced to use his HP to cast the sword’s magic.</p>
              <p>Soon after acquiring the sword, he set out on a quest to find the Dark Wizard All for One and put an end to his evil actions. While his adventure has just started, he has made great friends and allies in the Silver Knight Tenya Iida and the Good Witch Ochako Uraraka!</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Headstrong, determined, and proud, Izuku embodies the leadership qualities he thinks that a Paladin should have. He is stubborn and positive enough to come off as something of a fool, charging headlong into situations where he has very little chance of surviving, and coming out with a grin and a carefree comment on how exciting it was.</p>
              <p>Really, he's rather doubtful of his abilities. He's worried about leading his friend into a battle they can't win, but feels he needs to keep up a confident mask so that people don't see how uncertain the Paladin is. Due to his Toshinori being dead already, he has taken up the mask of the Symbol of Peace full force. As a result, he makes an effort to seem carefree (to the point of coming off a little airheaded), while actually being quite attentive to his surroundings.</p>

          <h1>Swordplay</h1>
          <p>While not particularly experienced in any one style, Izuku has been wielding his sword in many desperate and life-threatening situations, and is experienced enough to face up against many different kinds of enemies. He would likely lose in a duel with rules, though.</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Equipment</div>
          <h1>Holy Sword One for All</h1>
          <p>A sword whose shape changes based on the wielder. It used to be a massive zanbatō while being wielded by All Might, but changed into the more usable arming sword it currently looks like for Izuku.</p>
          <p>As wielder of the Holy Sword One for All, Izuku has access to the spells that were most commonly used by the previous holders of the sword. He can also summon their spirits for a short time each day to advise him, but they cannot physically assist him. Normally Izuku is unable to use any kind of wand, but a special property of OFA allows him to use his HP instead of MP to cast spells.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Strength Up</b> - <i>Buff</i><br>Boosts the strength of the wielder to unimaginable heights. May cause muscle strain or limb breakage.</li>
            <li><b>Danger Sense</b> - <i>Always Active</i><br>One for All glows red when danger is around - the brighter and more vibrant, the closer and/or more dangerous it is. Can cause the sword to grow burning hot. Also makes stealth hard unless the sword is sheathed to hide the glow.</li>
            <li><b>Black Web</b> - <i>Dark Magic</i><br>Tendrils of darkness emerge from One for All, blanketing the area in violent and dangerous magic. can be used to push, pull, crush, stab, and many other physical effects. However, using this risks dark magic corruption.</li>
            <li><b>Wings</b> - <i>Light Magic</i><br>Creates two glowing wings on the user’s back.  The wings, while made of magic, act as physical wings. If they are damaged, the user feels the pain of it, but does not take damage to HP.</li>
            <li><b>Fa Jin</b> - <i>Force Magic</i><br>By casting this and slashing One for All through the air, the user sends a blade of pure force towards the target. It is not as sharp as a real blade, but has far greater range.</li>
            <li><b>Smokescreen</b> - <i>Illusion Magic</i><br>Creates an illusory cloud of smoke around the user. However, the user is also blinded by the smoke.</li>
          </ul>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>Izuku died when trying to save Katsuki from the slime villain. However, he discovered that he did, in fact, have a quirk: Ghost, which allowed him to live on after death as a spirit. He was still given One for All by All Might for his bravery and sacrifice, and attends UA as normal. He just has a few extra abilities (and a few emotional issues related to his death that he’s working out in therapy).</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Much like his regular counterpart, Izuku is kindhearted and genuinely wants to help people with all that he is. His goal of being a hero, and assuring Katsuki that his death wasn't his fault, are two of the things that bind him to the physical world, and are the center of his personality. He is also aware that having a dead classmate can be a little depressing to anyone, so he tries to stay cheerful and positive at all times, often brushing off when he feels unsure or in pain.</p>
              <p>He’s a little more confident and outspoken, not wanting to waste time when he knows how fleeting life is. Not only that, but he has been in regular therapy since his death, in order to build positive coping methods and keep a regular eye on his mental health. He attends solo sessions, as well as sessions with Katsuki.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- muse 1 tab 4 Abilities -->
          <br><hr>
          <div class="bio-title">Quirks</div>
          <h1>One for All</h1>
          <p>Stockpiles raw power for later use, resulting in amazing feats of strength, speed, and agility. The power can be used through his whole body, or can be focused into a single body part. He can (and should) limit the amount of power used at any given time. Using more power than his body can handle results in strain or massive injuries. Currently, he can continuously use 8% of One for All, and can briefly boost his power output to 20% without serious injuries.</p>
          <p>One for All can be transferred to another person through ingesting the DNA of the current user.</p>
          <p>Each time it is transferred, One for All also stockpiles the quirks of the previous wielder and adds it to the 'core' of One for All, allowing the next user to wield it alongside the stockpiling quirk. Quirks within One for All that Izuku currently has access to are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Blackwhip</b> - <i>The fifth user's quirk.</i><br>Creates tendrils of dark energy for grappling and increased mobility.</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Ghost</h1>
          <p>Izuku's own quirk, allowing his spirit to remain after death. He is more solidly bound to the mortal plane than other ghosts, and can be perceived even by people that are in no way sensitive to supernatural activity, but otherwise is the same as any other ghost.</p>
          <p>As a ghost, Izuku's physical form is greatly influenced by his self-image. He doesn't age unless he feels older, and anything that shakes his determination is a legitimate health risk as he may find his form falling apart. He is slightly fuzzy around the edges, but is visible unless he focuses on becoming invisible. The invisibility does not come naturally to him, though, as his self-image is very strongly of his usual, visible self. Generally, his default state is to be intangible, but it takes very little focus to become solid enough to pick things up or interact with people. And, finally, gravity has no effect on him, so he often finds himself floating without meaning to. Keeping his feet on the ground is difficult.</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Equipment</div>
          <h1>Ghost Comms</h1>
          <p>An earpiece crafted from various mystical objects that have been used to communicate with spirits, which was then infused with Izuku's energy. It works like a regular earpiece, but can turn invisible and intangible with Izuku. It works while invisible, but soundwaves move through it while intangible, so it doesn't work then.</p>

            <li>Izuku can see other ghosts and sense the supernatural. Unfortunately, ghosts do not look intangible to him, so he sees them as solidly as any living person. He has gotten confused about who is and isn't alive more than once.</li>
            <li>Izuku cannot sleep. However, occasionally his brain needs to rest, so he will 'phase out' sometimes. This mostly involves him getting a little blurrier and staring into space for anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. Originally he could not control when this happened, but at this point he can force it to happen when he has time to rest so it will not randomly occur during the day.</li>
            <li> In theory, Izuku does not need to work out to become physically stronger. However, he finds working out helps because he feels as if he's <i>earned</i> his growth, making it easier to have a stronger self-image.</li>
            <li>When he activates OFA at higher percentages, his ghost energy moves around the area and small objects around him tend to float. He has no real control over them, though.</li>
            <li> When possessing someone, he is capable of making them float, but it uses a lot of his energy.</li>

            <!-- muse 1 tab 5 Description -->
            <div class="right-side">
              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>Main difference to be aware of going in: During the training camp, Izuku was captured as well as Katsuki. While Katsuki was found, Izuku was not.</p>
              <p>Izuku was taken to a different location than Katsuki during his kidnapping. He struggled and fought, but was forcefully drained of blood by AFO himself (who just so happens to be a vampire in this one), and force-fed some of AFO’s blood in order to turn him.</p>
              <p>Since the process was so violent (<s>and because of plenty of compulsion on his Sire's part</s>), Izuku hardly retained any of his memories of being human. He has become incredibly attached to AFO in the two days that they were together, eagerly learning all he could from him. Although considering he doesn’t remember what One for All is, he wasn’t able to transfer it to AFO before the fight with All Might.</p>
              <p>With his Sire missing, Izuku managed to break out of the place he was being held, powered mostly by thirst and loneliness. He has only AFO’s teachings <s>and very vague impressions of people who used to be important to him</s> to guide him. He’s lost and confused, but positive he’ll find his dear Sire eventually. And if people get in his way, well, his Sire told him it was perfectly okay to kill them. After all, humans are basically cattle, right? And there’s plenty of them around, so no-one will miss any that are destroyed along the way.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Izuku's curiosity is held in check only by his anxiety. He has a deep desire to know more about everything and anything, including his past, but often becomes too afraid to actually carry out an investigation. He is also quick to get attached to anyone that shows him kindness, and often believes almost anything he is told. The exception is anything that contradicts what his Sire tells him, since he is compelled to believe that over anything else. Despite that compulsion, though, he often questions the crueller aspects of what his Sire tells him.</p>
              <p>All that being said, as a vampire, Izuku was left completely without guidance. As a result he is almost feral, and often driven almost entirely by instinct to hunt. This does not make him <i>animalistic</i>, though, as a vampire's nature means it will use everything in its power to get a meal. This includes negotiation, so he can be somewhat charming when in the middle of a hunt.</p>

          <!-- muse 1 tab 5 Abilities -->
          <br><hr>
          <div class="bio-title">Quirk</div>
          <h1>One for All</h1>
          <p>Stockpiles raw power for later use, resulting in amazing feats of strength, speed, and agility. The power can be used through his whole body, or can be focused into a single body part. He can (and should) limit the amount of power used at any given time. Using more power than his body can handle results in strain or massive injuries. Currently, he can continuously use 8% of One for All, and can briefly boost his power output to 20% without serious injuries.</p>
          <p>One for All can be transferred to another person through ingesting the DNA of the current user.</p>
          <p>Each time it is transferred, One for All also stockpiles the quirks of the previous wielder and adds it to the 'core' of One for All, allowing the next user to wield it alongside the stockpiling quirk. Quirks within One for All that Izuku currently has access to are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Blackwhip</b> - <i>The fifth user's quirk.</i><br>Creates tendrils of dark energy for grappling and increased mobility.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="bio-title">Other Abilities</div>
          <h1>Compulsion</h1>
          <p>Able to influence the thoughts and memories of those around him using his vampiric abilities. It is a battle of wills - people can often push through or shake off compulsion if their willpower is greater than the vampire's in question, although the effort required is likely to throw them off from whatever they were doing. Compulsion usually requires the vampire's voice to be heard and words to be understood to take effect. Eye contact increases the strength of the compulsion, but is not required. The only time compulsion does not require vocal commands is when the vampire is actively feeding on someone - then the vampire can press their will into the bite with just their mind.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Memory Alteration</b><br>Compulsion can change memories, or lock them away entirely. However, the vampire in question only gets to apply their will when they first make someone forget, while the person under the effect gets to chip away at the command with their will at any point. Powerful vampires can change or alter memories for some time, but if someone has reason to doubt the changed or mission memories, they will usually eventually break through the compulsion.</li>
            <li><b>Thrall-Making</b><br>By pressing their will into a bite and commanding someone to become theirs, vampires can turn someone into a Thrall. This makes them unable to refuse a direct command from said vampire or directly harm them in any way unless given specific permission. Also creates a mark like a thick, dark tattoo, almost always of flowers with some meaning relating to the relationship between the Thrall and vampire. If a Thrall or a vampire dies, the vampire or Thrall</li> they are bonded to will feel it as if a portion of their soul has been carved away.
          </ul>
          <h1>Levitation</h1>
          <p>Able to float in the air, though it requires concentration to pull off. It is not full flight, and not particularly fast on its own. The force applied only pushes upwards. To move in any other direction while flying requires pushing off of another surface. Changing direction while mid-air without pushing off of something else is impossible. It can be used to slow falling by applying less upwards force than there is gravitational pull.</p>
          <h1>Healing</h1>
          <p>With a proper supply of blood, a vampire can heal their own wounds. It isn't immediate, but it is much faster than a regular human, healing from major injuries in less than an hour. However, the healing does not work if the injury was inflicted by a blessed or silver weapon.</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Equipment</div>
          <h1>Iron Soles</h1>
          <p>Created by Mei. Attaches to Izuku's shoes and increases the power of his kicks by absorbing the impact of his kicks and redistributing it back into extra force.</p>
          <h1>Air Force Gloves</h1>
          <p>Created by Mei. Gloves used to concentrate pressurized bursts of air, allowing Izuku to use OFA for long-distance attacks. He does not remember how to use them.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>Kidnapped at an unspecified time (could be almost any point after the League started targeting Izuku) and taken away to the League. There, he was turned into a Living Nomu - the first and currently only one of its kind. He retained much of his memory and personality, although like all nomu he cannot refuse orders from his master. Despite that, though, he retains his drive to be a hero, somehow. It is likely the only reason he survived the process with so much of himself intact is because of One for All strengthening him, and preparing his body to take on multiple quirks.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>While he is a little more anxious than usual, Izuku's personality remains virtually unchanged. He is a little quicker to get attached or get angry, but has noticed those changes and tries his best to act the way he did before.</p>
              <p>However, in some versions of this AU, he has another mental state that he can occasionally be pushed into that is more like a subservient nomu. While like that, he is fiercely loyal to the League and to <a href="https://dynamitem.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" title="dynamitem">Katsuki</a>. While he does have independent thought, he is often too uncertain to act on it, and will wait for commands from someone he trusts to actually act. While in that state, he calls himself 'Vanus'. Once he reverts back to his normal state, he has trouble remembering what he has done while like that, though he does get bits and pieces.</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Quirk</div>
          <h1>One for All</h1>
          <p>Stockpiles raw power for later use, resulting in amazing feats of strength, speed, and agility. The power can be used through his whole body, or can be focused into a single body part. He can (and should) limit the amount of power used at any given time. Using more power than his body can handle results in strain or massive injuries. Currently, he can continuously use 8% of One for All, and can briefly boost his power output to 20% without serious injuries.</p>
          <p>One for All can be transferred to another person through ingesting the DNA of the current user.</p>
          <p>Each time it is transferred, One for All also stockpiles the quirks of the previous wielder and adds it to the 'core' of One for All, allowing the next user to wield it alongside the stockpiling quirk. Quirks within One for All that Izuku currently has access to are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Blackwhip</b> - <i>The fifth user's quirk.</i><br>Creates tendrils of dark energy for grappling and increased mobility.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="bio-title">Nomu Quirks</div>
          <h1>Dragonfly Wings</h1>
          <p>Has a set of dragonfly wings growing from his back. The muscles in his back and chest are also adjusted in order to allow him to move them. The wings are not entirely like a dragonfly's, though, as they have been altered to be waterproof. Despite being rather thin and frail-looking, they are capable of flight.</p>
          <h1>Gills</h1>
          <p>A set of gills and lungs adapted to breathing in both air and water. Other underwater adaptations include a second eyelid to protect the eyes underwater.</p>
          <h1>Feline Attributes</h1>
          <p>Cat-like ears and eyes to enhance hearing and night vision.</p>

          <p>Created by Mei. Attaches to Izuku's shoes and increases the power of his kicks by absorbing the impact of his kicks and redistributing it back into extra force.</p>
          <h1>Air Force Gloves</h1>
          <p>Created by Mei. Gloves used to concentrate pressurized bursts of air, allowing Izuku to use OFA for long-distance attacks.</p>

            <li>Izuku's wings are almost never still. They flutter and flicker in different ways depending on his mood.</li>
            <li>Because of Izuku's second eyelids, he doesn't need to blink often at all. He has a bad habit of staring unnervingly.</li>
            <li>The Living Nomu Process:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Obedience - Drug injected directly into the spinal cord, near the neck, that numbs the human mind and induces a more pliant, obedient state. Effects are immediate, but take roughly 4 hours to become permanent (subject may not obey all orders before then). Human subject must be conscious during injection.</li>
              <li>Before each quirk is applied, blood must be cycled out and completely cleaned. [IMPORTANT - clean blood cycling equipment THOROUGHLY between each quirk application]. Cleaned blood will be less likely to resist new quirks.</li>
              <li>Quirks can then be applied one at a time [IMPORTANT - more than one at a time will kill subject]. Recommended that quirks with smaller effects be applied first. Extracted quirks must be injected into the bone marrow, brain, and bloodstream simultaneously. Quirks with physical aspects may need surgical assistance to grow properly.</li>
              <li>Re-apply obedience serum after each new quirk addition, and then allow another resting period of at least 4 hours (more if the subject is struggling with the new quirk).</li>
              <li>Repeat from step 2 for each quirk.</li>
            </ol>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>Izuku Midoriya, while registered as quirkless, has had a quirk all along. He inherited All for One from his father, with the added bonus of being able to attract quirks to him without touching the person using his mother's ability. However, Inko insisted on raising him away from his father and, since he was always told his quirk was a villain's quirk, he acted quirkless since a young age.</p>
              <p>What his mother doesn't know is, he has been in contact with his father all along. He has learned a few select lessons from his father, namely the unfair nature of society, as well as how to play dirty to get what he wants. Thankfully, despite being co-parented by a villain, Izuku is still trying to become a hero, even using his 'villainous' quirk (or, depending on who encourages him down what path, pretending to be quirkless the whole time).</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Izuku's personality is very similar to his regular AU's personality, though he does often take more crafty solutions to problems. Being who he is, he can't afford to take a straightforward, sportsman-like approach to things.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="bio-title">Quirk</div>
          <h1>All for One (V2)</h1>
          <p>Gives the user the ability to take and use the quirks of others, and give them to whoever they wish. While it does help the user to hold many quirks at once, <i>using</i> too many at once causes great strain on the body. Not only that, but it does not transfer the knowledge of how to use the quirk, that is something that the user must figure out on their own.</p>
          <p>The user is capable of taking Mutant-type quirks, removing the mutation from the original user. However, the user of One for All does not immediately manifest those mutations, and can instead call on them when needed.</p>
          <p>When Izuku inherited this quirk from his father, he also inherited aspects from Inko's quirk. He is able to pull quirks towards himself the same way she can pull small objects, removing the need to be touching the target (though direct contact makes it easier). However he can't 'throw' quirks to people, and must be directly touching them to give them a quirk.</p>
          <p>While he has a quirk, Izuku interprets them as a slightly separate entity to himself - not quite alive, but with their own will. Often he will 'talk' to quirks to 'teach them life lessons', often making them easier to use. This usually permanently alters them when he gives them back, though only in subtle ways. (For example in one thread, he taught <a href="https://futurexheroes.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" title="futurexheroes">Katsuki</a>'s Explosion that moderation is often the key to victory, making it easier to finely tune the power output of explosions.)</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>Izuku Midoriya, while registered as quirkless, has had a quirk all along. He inherited All for One from his father, with the added bonus of being able to attract quirks to him without touching the person using his mother's ability. However, Inko insisted on raising him away from his father and, since he was always told his quirk was a villain's quirk, he acted quirkless since a young age.</p>
              <p>While out on a walk one day, Izuku and Inko were caught in a villain attack. Inko was killed trying to protect Izuku, who was likely going to die as well. However, he was saved by All Smite who (after finding out his quirk) took the boy under his wing.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Izuku presents his personality is very similar to his regular AU's, but inwardly he is always scheming. He wants to create a perfect world using his quirk, and will do anything to rise to godhood and rule 'benevolently' over everyone... At least, everyone who cooperates.</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Quirks</div>
          <h1>All for One (V2)</h1>
          <p>Gives the user the ability to take and use the quirks of others, and give them to whoever they wish. While it does help the user to hold many quirks at once, <i>using</i> too many at once causes great strain on the body. Not only that, but it does not transfer the knowledge of how to use the quirk, that is something that the user must figure out on their own.</p>
          <p>The user is capable of taking Mutant-type quirks, removing the mutation from the original user. However, the user of One for All does not immediately manifest those mutations, and can instead call on them when needed.</p>
          <p>When Izuku inherited this quirk from his father, he also inherited aspects from Inko's quirk. He is able to pull quirks towards himself the same way she can pull small objects, removing the need to be touching the target (though direct contact makes it easier). However he can't 'throw' quirks to people, and must be directly touching them to give them a quirk.</p>
          <p>While he has a quirk, Izuku interprets them as a slightly separate entity to himself - not quite alive, but with their own will. Often he will 'talk' to quirks to 'teach them life lessons', often making them easier to use. This usually permanently alters them when he gives them back, though only in subtle ways.</p>
          <h1>Big Impact</h1>
          <p>Creates blasts of pure force from the user's hands, capable of doing anything from pushing things to completely blasting through them with force. Overuse makes the user's arms go numb and limp.</p>
          <p>Izuku stole this quirk from the villain that killed his mother, and never returned it.</p>

            <!-- muse 2 tab 1 Description -->
            <div class="right-side">
              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>The default AU. Moderately canon compliant and up to date with the events of the anime's dub. May lag behind an episode or two if the mun falls behind watching new episodes. May occasionally include references to / foreshadowing of manga spoilers the mun has heard about.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Loud, brash, and egotistical, Katsuki is the sort that isn't afraid to hold back in anything he says or does. He firmly believes that he is a powerful and talented person with the potential to become great as long as he never stops pushing forwards. There is an edge of desperation with which he pursues his goals, one that he does his best to hide.</p>
              <p>While he is extremely tuned into the emotions of others most of the time, he refuses to try to reach any sort of understanding of his own emotions. Anger is a comfortable fallback for him when he feels something he doesn't understand or doesn't want to acknowledge.</p>
              <p>Despite claiming not to care about what anyone wants from him, he is constantly aware of the expectations put upon him by others. Starting from childhood, when his strong quirk developed, people have always expected great things from him. Privately, he often feels like he has no hope of measuring up to the version of him people want him to be.</p>
              <p>At the same time, he is also greatly aware of what others think of his standoffish and abrasive personality. He knows that people think of him as a villain risk, and secretly worries that he will never be able to escape his past as a bully or redeem himself. That fear is often expressed as resentful anger.</p>
              <p>The two expectations people have for him - a great hero and a terrible villain - leave him constantly tense and defensive, and very aware of which actions of his fit which expectation. He thinks so much about that, there is hardly room for him to be a regular, flawed human being. He sometimes thinks of himself as an inhuman collection of expectations and unacknowledged trauma.</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Quirk</div>
          <h1>Explosion</h1>
          <p>Sweats a nitroglycerin-like substance that can be ignited at will to form powerful explosions.</p>
          <p>Bakugo has incredible control over his quirk, able to regulate the size, power, and direction of the blasts with pinpoint accuracy. He uses them not only for attacks, but also as a method of propulsion to increase his speed and agility, and even to simulate flying. The concussive force of his blows can also be used to shatter brittle objects, move objects or people out of the way, catapult objects or people, or shield him from attacks.</p>
          <p>There are a few specific variations that use explosions in different ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Stun Grenade</b><br>Creates a sphere in his hands that explodes in a violent flash. It is a less concussive blast, and more just heat and light. Useful for stunning enemies while doing very little actual damage.</li>
            <li><b>Howitzer Impact</b><br>Rapid spinning in the air creates a vortex that increases the power of the next explosion to that of a missle.</li>
            <li><b>AP Shot</b> - <i>Armour Piercing Shot</i><br>An explosion focused on a single point rather than the entire palm. Has the strength to blast directly through a solid concrete wall.</li>
            <li><b>AP Shot: Auto Cannon</b><br>A rapid-fire, weaker version of AP Shot made specifically for hitting human opponents without killing them.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="bio-title">Headcanons</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Katsuki's quirk has a number of effects on his health:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The nitroglycerine-like substance he sweats is also, in smaller doses, in his blood. It slows his heart rate, and his body has adapted by putting him in a highly tense state at all times. Relaxing too much could drop his blood pressure to dangerous levels.</li>
              <li>Because his blood is filled with a nitroglycerine-<i>like</i> substance, but not actual nitroglycerine, no doctor can accurately say what medications will and will not react well with Katsuki. As such, he mostly avoids them, and will usually avoid things like caffeine, too. He does have some brands that he knows he can safely take, though, and his medical record details that and forbids applying other medications.</li>
              <li>Katsuki has no natural resistance to the sound of his explosions. As a child he refused to wear ear protection, leading to him needing hearing aids by the time he reached UA. He had special support items made that combine the functionality of hearing aids, ear protection, and wireless earbuds. The items are shaped slightly like hearing aids, but are much harder to see. He wears them at all times, except when cleaning them or when he's in the shower (despite medical advice that</li> he should remove them when he's asleep).
            </ul>
            <li>Because his poor hearing was predicted early in his life, Katsuki learned JSL from an early age.</li>
            <li>Because of his quirk, Katsuki's sweat tastes like salted caramel. The sweet taste of the nitroglycerin-like substance mixed with the salt in his sweat is what makes that taste. It does not mean his sweat is actually good to eat.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>As a result of constantly being surrounded by the sweet smell of his quirk, Katsuki doesn't have much of a sweet tooth.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Katsuki has always been touch-averse due to his constantly elevated level of stress.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Katsuki's touch aversion only got worse after the three main examples of him being confined or held against his will (see below).</li>
              <li>However, if he is allowed to instigate it, he does find some forms of touch comforting. If he trusts someone enough, he will sometimes grab their hand and put it on top of his head to show he wants head pats, or take someone's hand and squeeze it tightly in his own.</li>
              <li>Areas that even trusted people cannot touch at any time are his neck and wrists.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Despite denying it, Katsuki has had three major moments of trauma related to confinement, which he often has nightmares about. In order of appearance, they are:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The Sludge Villain - He mostly remembers the feeling of his limbs moving on his own, his quirk being used against his will, choking, the lightheadedness, and the fact that so many heroes stood by and watched (expecting him to be strong enough to hold out until someone 'better suited' to rescue him arrived).</li>
              <li>The Sports Festival - The least dangerous of the three, but still traumatic. He mostly remembers the people watching him, not realizing that his struggles were not entirely due to anger and were in fact panic-fuelled. This includes several people that he trusted greatly at the time (mostly UA staff).</li>
              <li>Kidnapped by the LOV - The most traumatic, and the event that increased his anxiety and touch aversion, as well as brought the other two events into a much more present and traumatic light. He still vividly remembers the feeling of Dabi's hand on his neck, refusing to eat or drink for the entire event, and the warping ooze choking him.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Katsuki's trademark 'battle grin' is actually a nervous tic that makes him grin uncontrollably when he tenses in certain ways (usually when anxiousness is paired with high adrenaline). It's similar to bearing his teeth more than it is a look of genuine enjoyment, most of the time.</li>
            <li>Katsuki is one of the few people that know how to calm Izuku down from a meltdown, since he knows enough about Izuku's ASD to know what is comforting and what is triggering to him.</li>
            <li>The top drawer of Katsuki's desk in his dorm room is filled with medication for his heart, as well as sleeping pills. The heart medication is used properly, but the sleeping pills are almost always unopened because he stubbornly refuses to use them.</li>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>(<i>Note: This backstory is specific to the version of this AU with my own Villain Izuku. However, this AU will be used for any Izuku that turned into a villain before UA started. Feel free to pick and choose parts of this backstory that apply.</i>)</p>
              <p>Katsuki had tormented Izuku for years, trying to get him to give up on the path of becoming a hero. It was a combination of jealousy over and worry about that self-sacrificial aspect of his best friend that made him so aggressive towards him, culminating in him telling Izuku to 'take a swan dive off the roof'. He didn't think that Izuku would ever listen to something like that.</p>
              <p>When he saw Izuku falling from the roof later that day, he was struck by fear and regret. Immediately, he used his quirk to race to catch Izuku. While he did manage to break Izuku's fall, both of them were severely injured and had to be taken to hospital urgently.</p>
              <p>Bakugo's injuries were less severe, so he was released earlier than Izuku. He intended to visit his friend, but the guilt he felt from the incident made him freeze every time he tried to walk through the door. He never ended up visiting at all, and Izuku never learned of Katsuki acting to save him.</p>
              <p>Katsuki continued on to apply to UA.</p>
              <p><b>Sub-AU: <a href="https://ooh-ouch-me-bones.tumblr.com/tagged/Swan%20Dive%3B%3B%20Fledgling%20Bakugo">Fledgling</a></b></p>
              <p>After finding out one of Izuku's old tormentors was killed in a 'mugging gone wrong', Katsuki grew suspicious. The wounds on the victim seemed too deliberate to be a coincidence. That, combined with the fact Izuku has gone missing, has him incredibly suspicious. Still, he won't tell anyone else his suspicions until he has proof, not wanting to hurt Izuku any more than he already has.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Katsuki is a quieter (though no less angry) student. He keeps his head down and stays out of most of the shenanigans that the rest of the class does. He hardly talks to anyone at all. He is incredibly focused on pursuing his goal of becoming a great hero, but there is a lack of fire in him, replaced only with grim determination.</p>

          <h1>Explosion</h1>
          <p>Sweats a nitroglycerin-like substance that can be ignited at will to form powerful explosions.</p>
          <p>Bakugo has incredible control over his quirk, able to regulate the size, power, and direction of the blasts with pinpoint accuracy. He uses them not only for attacks, but also as a method of propulsion to increase his speed and agility, and even to simulate flying. The concussive force of his blows can also be used to shatter brittle objects, move objects or people out of the way, catapult objects or people, or shield him from attacks.</p>
          <p>There are a few specific variations that use explosions in different ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Stun Grenade</b><br>Creates a sphere in his hands that explodes in a violent flash. It is a less concussive blast, and more just heat and light. Useful for stunning enemies while doing very little actual damage.</li>
            <li><b>Howitzer Impact</b><br>Rapid spinning in the air creates a vortex that increases the power of the next explosion to that of a missle.</li>
            <li><b>AP Shot</b> - <i>Armour Piercing Shot</i><br>An explosion focused on a single point rather than the entire palm. Has the strength to blast directly through a solid concrete wall.</li>
            <li><b>AP Shot: Auto Cannon</b><br>A rapid-fire, weaker version of AP Shot made specifically for hitting human opponents without killing them.</li>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>The Dragon Kingdom is a land full of proud, stubborn people. Of all of them, Katsuki Bakugo may be the one that most embodies those traits. The people of the Dragon Kingdom work closely with dragons and are quite social with them, knowing that the best way for them to resist invasion from the neighbouring Fire Kingdom is to work together. However, an actual Dragonbond is quite a rare and powerful thing, formed by chance. It is something like a soulmate, though the nature of the relationship between each Dragonbonded pair is not necessarily romantic.</p>
              <p>Katsuki realized he had a Dragonbond with Kirishima when he was only four, an unusually young age. He suddenly got the sense that someone important was in danger, and ran to them without a second thought. What he found was a tiny dragon being attacked by a wild dog. He was quick to save him, taking him in and demanding his parents make sure that the best doctors treated the young dragon's wounds. They were inseparable from that day on, with Kirishima riding on Katsuki's shoulders until he got too big. When that happened, they reversed positions, with Katsuki riding on Kirishima's back whenever they travelled outside of the Bakugo Estate.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Loud and brash, Katsuki's personality could easily be taken for overconfidence. However, his dramatic and large personality is his way of presenting a strong front for the people of his land, and to come off as a strong future king to his enemies. He is stubborn and headstrong, but puts the good of the people ahead of his own pride (even if it is painful for him and he has to do it through gritted teeth). The only thing fiercer than his temper is his loyalty.</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Abilities</div>
          <h1>Explosive Magic Mastery</h1>
          <p>Outside of magic related to his Dragonbond, Katsuki focused on only a single kind of magic: Explosions. As such, he has practically mastered the art, but is unable to use any other kind of magic.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Stunning Blast</b><br>Creates a sphere in his hands that explodes in a violent flash. It is a less concussive blast, and more just heat and light. Useful for stunning enemies while doing very little actual damage.</li>
            <li><b>Comet Impact</b><br>Rapid spinning in the air creates a vortex that increases the power of the next explosion to that of a missle.</li>
            <li><b>Knight Slayer</b><br>An explosion focused on a single point rather than the entire palm. Has the strength to blast directly through a solid concrete wall.</li>
            <li><b>Knight Slayer: Volley</b><br>A rapid-fire, weaker version of Knight Slayer made specifically for hitting human opponents without killing them.</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Dragonbond</h1>
          <p>A technique created by the Bakugo family in order to communicate with the dragons that fill their skies, and is now a part of their DNA and learned automatically. Distance has no effect on a Dragonbond, as the human and dragon are linked down to their very souls.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Empathy</b><br>Dragonbonded can understand each other no matter what language they are speaking, and sometimes even without speaking at all. They can also tell when the other is in danger, and sometimes feel each other's pain.</li>
            <li><b>Shape-Change</b><br>Dragonbonded can take each other's forms, with the dragoon being able to become humanoid and the human being able to become a dragon. However, it is much easier for a dragon to become humanoid. For a human to become a dragon, even for a minute, takes an immense amount of magic. Changing forms like that has been known to kill humans, even ones as strong as Katsuki.</li>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>Partway through his first year at UA, Katsuki found out that <a href="https://futurexheroes.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" title="futurexheroes">Izuku</a> actually had a quirk all along: a zombie quirk that meant he had to keep eating brains to keep from going feral. Since Izuku sourced the brains from people who were already dead, Katsuki managed to justify it to himself despite his initial horror at the idea. Another side-effect of the quirk pushed Izuku to a 'zombie rage' if he is hit too hard.</p>
              <p>At some point, a villain hit Izuku too hard and, in a knee-jerk reaction, Katsuki blew the villain back into a building. He isn't completely sure, but he thinks the villain snapped their neck in the landing. But with Izuku in a rage, he didn't have time to check. To get Izuku out of the rage, he let him eat the villain's brain. Together, the two of them buried the body in the woods and agreed never to speak of it again. Both of them try to claim the guilt of being the one that killed the villain.</p>
              <p><b>Sub-AU: <a href="https://ooh-ouch-me-bones.tumblr.com/tagged/Bury%20A%20Friend%3B%3B%20Cannibal%20Class">Cannibal Class</a></b></p>
              <p>In an investigation gone wrong, Katsuki and Izuku ran into another zombie. At some point during the fight, Katsuki hit his head hard enough that he was slowly dying from the impact. Desperate, Izuku turned Katsuki into a zombie as well.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Generally close to his regular personality. However, Katsuki has periods of even higher paranoia and self-doubt, wondering if a murderer deserves to be a hero (even if it was an accident and done in the heat of the moment). He is more cautious about using his explosions, and has had panic attacks during class because he has thought he hurt a classmate with them.</p>
              <p><b>Sub-AU: <a href="https://ooh-ouch-me-bones.tumblr.com/tagged/Bury%20A%20Friend%3B%3B%20Cannibal%20Class">Cannibal Class</a></b></p>
              <p>As a zombie, Katsuki's emotions are incredibly dulled, often just coming up as uncomfortable feelings rather than the overwhelming ones from before. Although right after eating a brain, he gets much more intense spikes of sudden emotion relating to the kind of person the previous owner of the brain was.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>The default AU. Moderately canon compliant and up to date with the events of the anime's dub. May lag behind an episode or two if the mun falls behind watching new episodes. May occasionally include references to / foreshadowing of manga spoilers the mun has heard about.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Cool, calm, and confident, at least on the surface. Mostly, Shoto is lost in his own thoughts, or quietly observing things around him. He can come off as a bit airheaded due to his lack of experiences and his lapses of attention. Not only that, but he tends to forget to explain his thought processes, often asking a question that seems to come out of nowhere, or be unrelated to current events (despite there being a long train of thought leading up to it).</p>
              <p>Shoto tends to undervalue himself, often focusing on areas where he could improve before even considering his strengths. This is true of his combat and social abilities. He is aware that he is strong in combat, but takes a moment to identify exactly how.</p>
              <p>Generally, Shoto has quite an open attitude towards people, always ready to believe that they are (on the whole) good unless they prove otherwise or are being overtly suspicious. He tends to take words at face value, and thus hates liars, as well as the act of lying itself. Not only does his strong sense of justice make him feel that it's simply wrong to take advantage of peoples' trust, he also thinks that it overcomplicates things and makes life harder than it already is.</p>
              <p>Despite generally believing most things, he does have a rather cynical attitude towards those who have proven themselves untrustworthy or villainous in the past, and is slow to forgive. While he will put his dislike of people aside in order to accomplish a goal, he makes it clear that it does not mean he likes or trusts them. He doesn't realize how that can make things awkward for the people working with him.</p>
              <p>He also tends to share that cynicism towards luck, chance, or fate as well.</p>

          <h1>Half-Cold Half-Hot</h1>
          <p>Can create ice from his right side and fire from his left side. While he has a general resistance to heat and cold, using too much of one element will start to take a toll on him (either causing frostbite or heatstroke). He is able to use both at the same time, but it requires more focus which slows his reaction speed.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Shoto has a bad habit of staring at people as he tries to figure out how to talk to them or phrase a question.</li>
            <li>Shoto's temperature difference on either side of his body isn't extreme, but it is noticeable. He isn't fully comfortable in any weather, with one side always being either too hot or cold. Still, having his quirk cancelled and feeling both sides returning to a regular temperature stresses him out.</li>
            <li>Shoto's scar is not just a regular burn scar, it is actually a frostburn scar. While the boiling water did burn him quite badly, the application of ice to the wound is the main cause of the scarring.</li>
            <li>While Shoto is fine with boiling water, he doesn't like it to be anywhere near his face. He tends to subtly cool down any warm drink given to him using his quirk.</li>
            <li>While most boiling water is fine, kettles that are in the process of boiling stress him out, especially if they are audibly doing so. Hearing a kettle whistling will often make him try to quietly leave the area until the sound stops.</li>
            <li>Current list of Shoto’s defense mechanisms, picked up from living in the Todoroki household:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Walks silently.</li>
              <li>Able to easily identify anything that makes noise in a matter of hours after entering a new place (squeaky floorboard, creaky door, etc) and can tell where someone is in his environment based off of which ‘sound spots’ they trigger.</li>
              <li>Memorizes the footsteps of individual people and can identify them from far off.</li>
              <li>Face goes entirely flat during moments where he feels trapped, but not currently under direct threat (to subconsciously keep from making the ‘wrong’ expression and triggering escalation). Will also usually go silent in those times.</li>
              <li>Avoidance and appeasement: Most confrontations (outside of physical fights), he will just take the first opportunity to leave. If leaving isn’t an option, he will often say or do something he thinks might de-escalate the situation, or at least create an opportunity to leave.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>When Shoto eats especially hot or cold food, he tends to hold it in either the left or right sides of his mouth. Whichever side is closest to the temperature that doesn’t match the food. He tends to feel the actual sensation better that way, since if he used the side that matched the temperature it would feel ‘room temperature’ to him.</li>
            <li>Shoto has tried cooking several times, and theoretically is capable of it. But that’s only under strict supervision. He thrives with recipes and instructions that are precise, but as soon as an element of uncertainty is introduced (ie ‘a pinch of salt’ or ‘season to taste’) he completely destroys the meal.</li>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>At a young age, Shoto managed to make it out of the Todoroki estate and found himself in a random alley. He was recognised by a group of small-time villains, who started to harass him. As a tiny child, he became overwhelmed and burst into tears. In a panic, the villains did their best to calm him down, sitting with him, guiding his breathing, and getting him some water. He was shocked by their kindness, and kept sneaking out to meet them.</p>
              <p>From there, he started giving the villains information that he gathered from his father, though they never asked him to do that for them. He just wanted to help the people who were kind to him. As he grew, he started giving information to all kinds of villains, including the League.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Quiet and reserved. He is not <i>dis</i>interested in other people, but tries to keep his distance for his and their own good. Even after being broken out of his icy aloofness, he tries hard (and utterly fails) to not get too attached to the people around him. He cares and feels deeply and with his whole heart, despite how painful that is for him.</p>
              <p>Despite being the biggest liar of all of them, he despises lies and liars. He thinks that lies only cause pain, whether or not they are eventually revealed.</p>

              <p>White hair, blue eyes, and Shoto's usual scar. Carries massive trauma. Cautious and observant, he cares deeply about everyone and everything, but has a bad habit of brutal honesty or completely hiding his feelings. He has Shoto's ice quirk.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>A fairly young vampire who has spent his entire life hidden away in the Todoroki estate. Not only is he a natural-born vampire of two very powerful full-blooded, natural-born vampires, he was also infected with several other vampire venoms throughout his life to create the perfect vampire. While he is an excellent hunter, and naturally talented in everything inhuman, he has trouble controlling his urges and fitting in with society. He also doesn't know exactly which traits he has inherited from each kind of vampire involved in his creation.</p>
              <p>(<i>This means that traits can be negotiated on a per-thread basis, especially the effect of surviving one of his bites.</i>)</p>
              <p>Vampires are not common knowledge, however most of the faculty is aware of what the Todoroki family is. Through the school, Shoto is provided with medication that muffles his vampiric cravings, disadvantages, and abilities. Shoto does his best to get through the days as a normal hero student. If he attacks or drinks from even one person while attending school there, he will be removed from school and sent back to his family. Depending on the severity of the attack, there is a chance his whole family will have to flee the country.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Quiet and reserved, Shoto holds his secret as close as he can with as few lies as possible. He has been restricted to only the Todoroki Estate for the entirety of his life before UA, and isn't used to mingling with regular people at all. He finds any approach, loud or quiet, a little intimidating. But once someone is close to him, he can't help but be warm and affectionate to them, even if it is in quiet ways.</p>
              <p>For once, Shoto holds his father's opinion of him in high regard, though he doesn't exactly <i>like</i> the man. He struggles trying to live up to the Todoroki name, and protect their secret so that none of his family need to be uprooted from their current home.</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Quirk</div>
          <h1>Half-Cold Half-Hot</h1>
          <p>Can create ice from his right side and fire from his left side. While he has a general resistance to heat and cold, using too much of one element will start to take a toll on him (either causing frostbite or heatstroke). He is able to use both at the same time, but it requires more focus which slows his reaction speed.</p>
          <p>His super moves include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Heaven-Piercing Ice Wall</b><br>Creates a massive glacier.</li>
            <li><b>Wall of Flames</b><br>Covers a large area in flames.</li>
            <li><b>Flashfreeze Heatwave</b><br>Cools the air around him, and then quickly heats it, causing a superheated blast.</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Compulsion</h1>
          <p>Able to influence the thoughts and memories of those around him using his vampiric abilities. It is a battle of wills - people can often push through or shake off compulsion if their willpower is greater than the vampire's in question, although the effort required is likely to throw them off from whatever they were doing. Compulsion usually requires the vampire's voice to be heard and words to be understood to take effect. Eye contact increases the strength of the compulsion, but is not required. The only time compulsion does not require vocal commands is when the vampire is actively feeding on someone - then the vampire can press their will into the bite with just their mind.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Memory Alteration</b><br>Compulsion can change memories, or lock them away entirely. However, the vampire in question only gets to apply their will when they first make someone forget, while the person under the effect gets to chip away at the command with their will at any point. Powerful vampires can change or alter memories for some time, but if someone has reason to doubt the changed or mission memories, they will usually eventually break through the compulsion.</li>
            <li><b>Thrall-Making</b><br>By pressing their will into a bite and commanding someone to become theirs, vampires can turn someone into a Thrall. This makes them unable to refuse a direct command from said vampire or directly harm them in any way unless given specific permission. Also creates a mark like a thick, dark tattoo, almost always of flowers with some meaning relating to the relationship between the Thrall and vampire. If a Thrall or a vampire dies, the vampire or Thrall</li> they are bonded to will feel it as if a portion of their soul has been carved away.
          </ul>
          <h1>Levitation</h1>
          <p>Able to float in the air, though it requires concentration to pull off. It is not full flight, and not particularly fast on its own. The force applied only pushes upwards. To move in any other direction while flying requires pushing off of another surface. Changing direction while mid-air without pushing off of something else is impossible. It can be used to slow falling by applying less upwards force than there is gravitational pull.</p>
          <h1>Healing</h1>
          <p>With a proper supply of blood, a vampire can heal their own wounds. It isn't immediate, but it is much faster than a regular human, healing from major injuries in less than an hour. However, the healing does not work if the injury was inflicted by a blessed or silver weapon.</p>

            <li>The Tororoki family are natural-born vampires, basically vampire royalty. Natural-born vampires have the most variation in vampiric traits.</li>
            <li>Genetically, Shoto was bred to be an incredibly powerful vampire, but these traits make it harder for him to pretend to be human. He is determined to get through with effort alone.</li>
            <li>While most vampires need to completely drain a victim and feed them vampire blood to create vampire spawn, Shoto's bite automatically turns any human that survives it. (This trait is negotiable on a per-thread basis.)</li>
            <li>Natural-born vampires age similarly to humans until their mid-twenties, when their aging dramatically slows.</li>

Recently, he has gone through a revelation about how much he has hurt his family, and is trying to prove himself as a husband and a father. Around his family, he is oddly awkward in his efforts to become closer to them.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>A powerful full-blooded, natural-born vampire, considered royalty among vampires. He is often a point of contact between vampiric communities in his area and the Hunters, using his status and power to protect the lives of vampires who do not break any of the rules (and even vampires that do, if they can stay in his good graces).</p>
              <p>His obsession with status is the result of living through years when Hunters would kill vampires without reason or mercy, and being part of the group that negotiated the rules that vampires must abide by to avoid execution.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Immensely focused on his family's status as a way to protect them from Hunters, Enji is a controlling and possessive husband and father. He is afraid for the lives of his family, but thinks that the only way to protect them is to make them strong and hold on to power the family has acquired to keep Hunters off their backs. To strangers, he is standoffish and doesn't make much effort while socializing. He is at his most polite while on official business.</p>

          <h1>Compulsion</h1>
          <p>Able to influence the thoughts and memories of those around him using his vampiric abilities. It is a battle of wills - people can often push through or shake off compulsion if their willpower is greater than the vampire's in question, although the effort required is likely to throw them off from whatever they were doing. Compulsion usually requires the vampire's voice to be heard and words to be understood to take effect. Eye contact increases the strength of the compulsion, but is not required. The only time compulsion does not require vocal commands is when the vampire is actively feeding on someone - then the vampire can press their will into the bite with just their mind.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Memory Alteration</b><br>Compulsion can change memories, or lock them away entirely. However, the vampire in question only gets to apply their will when they first make someone forget, while the person under the effect gets to chip away at the command with their will at any point. Powerful vampires can change or alter memories for some time, but if someone has reason to doubt the changed or mission memories, they will usually eventually break through the compulsion.</li>
            <li><b>Thrall-Making</b><br>By pressing their will into a bite and commanding someone to become theirs, vampires can turn someone into a Thrall. This makes them unable to refuse a direct command from said vampire or directly harm them in any way unless given specific permission. Also creates a mark like a thick, dark tattoo, almost always of flowers with some meaning relating to the relationship between the Thrall and vampire. If a Thrall or a vampire dies, the vampire or Thrall</li> they are bonded to will feel it as if a portion of their soul has been carved away.
          </ul>
          <h1>Levitation</h1>
          <p>Able to float in the air, though it requires concentration to pull off. It is not full flight, and not particularly fast on its own. The force applied only pushes upwards. To move in any other direction while flying requires pushing off of another surface. Changing direction while mid-air without pushing off of something else is impossible. It can be used to slow falling by applying less upwards force than there is gravitational pull.</p>
          <h1>Healing</h1>
          <p>With a proper supply of blood, a vampire can heal their own wounds. It isn't immediate, but it is much faster than a regular human, healing from major injuries in less than an hour. However, the healing does not work if the injury was inflicted by a blessed or silver weapon.</p>

              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Normally a calm, forgiving person, Rei has been through much in her life. Her willpower and kindness have been stretched to the limit, leading her to have lashed out at her family out of fear. However, time in a psychiatric facility has allowed her to recover quite a bit. She is intimately familiar with grief and regret, but hasn't allowed it to turn her bitter. She remains a kind, loving woman. A quiet soul, but not a weak one by any means.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>The daughter of a high-ranking, natural-born vampire family and the holder of a strong quirk, she was matched with Enji Todoroki almost immediately. They spent the first half of their life together on the run from Hunters, trying to hide themselves and survive. Rei was a major part of the group that negotiated the rules that vampires must abide by to avoid execution.</p>
              <p>However, later in life, her husband's obsession with status and power, and his increasingly controlling nature, wore down on Rei's mental state, causing her to lash out at her family. She was taken to a psychiatric facility run by Hunters that specializes in keeping vampires under control and in recovery, allowed to live only because of her long history with the Hunters, as well as the fact her problems were not related to bloodlust.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Due to her incredibly low bloodlust, Rei is able to act almost human, even in the presence of fresh open wounds. When not broken down, she has remarkable composure, and can be incredibly diplomatic.</p>

Compulsion usually requires the vampire's voice to be heard and words to be understood to take effect. Eye contact increases the strength of the compulsion, but is not required. The only time compulsion does not require vocal commands is when the vampire is actively feeding on someone - then the vampire can press their will into the bite with just their mind.</p>

However, the vampire in question only gets to apply their will when they first make someone forget, while the person under the effect gets to chip away at the command with their will at any point. Powerful vampires can change or alter memories for some time, but if someone has reason to doubt the changed or mission memories, they will usually eventually break through the compulsion.</li>

Also creates a mark like a thick, dark tattoo, almost always of flowers with some meaning relating to the relationship between the Thrall and vampire. If a Thrall or a vampire dies, the vampire or Thrall</li> they are bonded to will feel it as if a portion of their soul has been carved away.

          <p>A kit including blood bags to sate bloodthirst and promote healing, as well as pills that can be used to nullify the 'symptoms' of vampirism (allergy to the sun, etc) while dulling bloodlust, though the pills do dampen vampiric abilities and make them harder to use.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>The default AU. Moderately canon compliant and up to date with the events of the anime's dub. May lag behind an episode or two if the mun falls behind watching new episodes. May occasionally include references to / foreshadowing of manga spoilers the mun has heard about.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>A violent sociopath entirely focused on his own goals. Dabi puts on a confident and uncaring front, and that is (for the most part) genuine. However, he is more cautious than his sometimes maniacal nature lets on. He is sadistic, enjoying toying with his victims and psychologically breaking them before actually killing them.</p>
              <p>While he would happily die for his goals, he would only do as much if it would actually benefit them long-term, and won't throw his life away for a cheap win.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>Rejected by his father after the birth of Shoto, Touya began to become bitter, obsessed with surpassing his younger brother and proving himself to his father. It was bad enough that he even violently lashed out at Shoto when his brother was only a baby. Thankfully, this incident spurred his mother to send him to a professional therapist (despite Enji's protests). While his bitterness is not entirely gone, he did work through the majority of it, and stopped redirecting it to his siblings (though he does still feel resentment towards his parents for putting them in that situation).</p>
              <p>Refocused, Touya made up his mind to become a pro hero, regardless of what his father thought of that plan. He trained on his own, enduring some burns (but not nearly as badly as his default AU), but being careful to look after his own health so he would actually survive his training. He never applied to UA, in defiance of his father's original plan, choosing to forge his own path and apply to Ketsubutsu Academy.</p>
              <p>After graduation, he took his time becoming the Cremation Hero: Dabi, steadily rising through the ranks. He is currently in a comfortable middle position, still nowhere near the top, but working towards it. He plans to completely overshadow his father's legacy in every way he can.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>More relaxed in his day-to-day life, Touya knows his limits and works to push them steadily, in a healthy way. He's patient in his efforts, knowing that pushing himself and his quirk too hard will make him burn up before he can achieve anything. His attachments to his siblings help remind him to keep his cool, as remembering how undeserved his earlier bitterness towards them was reminds him to examine if his emotions are really an appropriate reaction to whatever is upsetting him.</p>
              <p>While he still has incredibly low empathy and <i>is</i> still a sociopath and a sadist, he has directed those traits in a more constructive way, saving his major 'indulgences' for the criminals he targets. He is known for his rough captures, treading the line of just how much he can legally injure a villain, but somehow still has yet to kill anyone.</p>

            <div class="right-side">
              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>The oldest child of the Todoroki clan, and a vampire that is declared 'kill on sight' by Hunters.</p>
              <p>Born during a time when vampires were still hunted without mercy, Dabi grew in an environment of fear and uncertainty, always on the run with his parents. He grew bitter and resentful of humanity, thinking them beneath vampires and lamenting at the unfairness of them hunting down vampires when the 'natural order' is the other way around.</p>
              <p>When his parents joined the negotiations between vampires and Hunters, his resentment only grew, directing towards the two of them as well. In his mind, they had sided with the humans over their own kind, only increasing human tyranny over vampires with their ceasefire. In a fit of rage, he attacked a a crowd of humans using both his quirk and his vampiric abilities in an open area, putting the secret of vampires' existence at risk, making him the number one target for Hunters in the area and excommunicating him from the Todoroki clan.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Much like his regular AU, but with an increased sense of superiority over humans and over any vampire that 'sides with humans' and 'makes themselves lesser than they really are'.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- muse 6 tab 3 Abilities -->
          <br><hr>
          <div class="bio-title">Quirk</div>
          <h1>Cremation</h1>
          <p>Creates incredibly hot blue flames from his body, capable of massive amounts of destruction. The flames become stronger the stronger Dabi's emotions are. Unfortunately, due to inheriting a resistance to cold instead of heat, using his quirk too much will cause Dabi serious burns.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Flashfire Fist</b> - <i>Endeavour's signature technique.</i><br>Raises his fire's temperature to its absolute maximum.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Jet Burn</b><br>Shoots a blast of fire at an opponent. Causes quite a lot of overheating.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Prominence Burn</b><br>Shoots a concentrated beam of flames from his entire body to vapourize a target.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="bio-title">Other Abilities</div>
          <h1>Compulsion</h1>
          <p>Able to influence the thoughts and memories of those around him using his vampiric abilities. It is a battle of wills - people can often push through or shake off compulsion if their willpower is greater than the vampire's in question, although the effort required is likely to throw them off from whatever they were doing. Compulsion usually requires the vampire's voice to be heard and words to be understood to take effect. Eye contact increases the strength of the compulsion, but is not required. The only time compulsion does not require vocal commands is when the vampire is actively feeding on someone - then the vampire can press their will into the bite with just their mind.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Memory Alteration</b><br>Compulsion can change memories, or lock them away entirely. However, the vampire in question only gets to apply their will when they first make someone forget, while the person under the effect gets to chip away at the command with their will at any point. Powerful vampires can change or alter memories for some time, but if someone has reason to doubt the changed or mission memories, they will usually eventually break through the compulsion.</li>
            <li><b>Thrall-Making</b><br>By pressing their will into a bite and commanding someone to become theirs, vampires can turn someone into a Thrall. This makes them unable to refuse a direct command from said vampire or directly harm them in any way unless given specific permission. Also creates a mark like a thick, dark tattoo, almost always of flowers with some meaning relating to the relationship between the Thrall and vampire. If a Thrall or a vampire dies, the vampire or Thrall</li> they are bonded to will feel it as if a portion of their soul has been carved away.
          </ul>
          <h1>Levitation</h1>
          <p>Able to float in the air, though it requires concentration to pull off. It is not full flight, and not particularly fast on its own. The force applied only pushes upwards. To move in any other direction while flying requires pushing off of another surface. Changing direction while mid-air without pushing off of something else is impossible. It can be used to slow falling by applying less upwards force than there is gravitational pull.</p>
          <h1>Healing</h1>
          <p>With a proper supply of blood, a vampire can heal their own wounds. It isn't immediate, but it is much faster than a regular human, healing from major injuries in less than an hour. However, the healing does not work if the injury was inflicted by a blessed or silver weapon.</p>

            </ul>
            <li>In most versions of this AU, AFO himself (another vampire) saved Dabi from the Hunters after he publicly attacked a crowd of people. He advised Dabi to look out for Shigaraki and ally himself with him. This is the only reason Dabi takes orders from a human. This plot point does not apply when someone else is writing AFO, unless they wish it to.</li>
            <li>Dabi's burns are actually sunburns from when he attacked a crowd, as Hunters were able to use UV weapons against him before he escaped them.</li>
            <li>Dabi's actual bloodlust is incredibly low. He is able to be around open wounds without reacting. However, he makes no effort to hold himself back from what few hunting instincts he <i>does</i> have, and is thus mistaken for an incredibly bloodthirsty vampire often.</li>

              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Kind to a fault, Fuyumi does her best to keep the peace in any situation she is put in. Her main priority is keeping the people around her safe and comfortable. She enjoys peace and quiet, and becomes quite uncomfortable in tense situations, often leading to her getting flustered and desperate to find a solution. Her naturally nurturing nature is a huge reason that she is so good with kids, and her conflict resolution skills are more attuned to solving fights between children rather than her peers and elders.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>The second-born child of the Todoroki clan, Fuyumi was the first born into an era of uneasy peace between vampires and Hunters. There was still tension, but there was far less reason to run and hide at the slightest hint of a Hunter in the area. She was born with fairly weak vampiric traits and little to no bloodlust, meaning she can interact in normal human society quite easily.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Fuyumi hates to rock the boat, mostly due to her upbringing. The tension between vampires and Hunters means that she was raised to deescalate conflict and try to make herself seem like the smallest threat possible in any situation.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- muse 7 tab 2 Abilities -->
          <br><hr>
          <div class="bio-title">Quirk</div>
          <h1>Ice</h1>
          <p>The ability to generate ice. Used too much, it will give her frostbite.</p>
          <div class="bio-title">Other Abilities</div>
          <h1>Compulsion</h1>
          <p>Able to influence the thoughts and memories of those around him using his vampiric abilities. It is a battle of wills - people can often push through or shake off compulsion if their willpower is greater than the vampire's in question, although the effort required is likely to throw them off from whatever they were doing. Compulsion usually requires the vampire's voice to be heard and words to be understood to take effect. Eye contact increases the strength of the compulsion, but is not required. The only time compulsion does not require vocal commands is when the vampire is actively feeding on someone - then the vampire can press their will into the bite with just their mind.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Memory Alteration</b><br>Compulsion can change memories, or lock them away entirely. However, the vampire in question only gets to apply their will when they first make someone forget, while the person under the effect gets to chip away at the command with their will at any point. Powerful vampires can change or alter memories for some time, but if someone has reason to doubt the changed or mission memories, they will usually eventually break through the compulsion.</li>
            <li><b>Thrall-Making</b><br>By pressing their will into a bite and commanding someone to become theirs, vampires can turn someone into a Thrall. This makes them unable to refuse a direct command from said vampire or directly harm them in any way unless given specific permission. Also creates a mark like a thick, dark tattoo, almost always of flowers with some meaning relating to the relationship between the Thrall and vampire. If a Thrall or a vampire dies, the vampire or Thrall</li> they are bonded to will feel it as if a portion of their soul has been carved away.
          </ul>
          <h1>Levitation</h1>
          <p>Able to float in the air, though it requires concentration to pull off. It is not full flight, and not particularly fast on its own. The force applied only pushes upwards. To move in any other direction while flying requires pushing off of another surface. Changing direction while mid-air without pushing off of something else is impossible. It can be used to slow falling by applying less upwards force than there is gravitational pull.</p>
          <h1>Healing</h1>
          <p>With a proper supply of blood, a vampire can heal their own wounds. It isn't immediate, but it is much faster than a regular human, healing from major injuries in less than an hour. However, the healing does not work if the injury was inflicted by a blessed or silver weapon.</p>

          <h1>Glasses</h1>
          <p>A regular pair of glasses. She needs them to see.</p>
          <h1>Emergency Vampire Rations</h1>
          <p>A kit including blood bags to sate bloodthirst and promote healing, as well as pills that can be used to nullify the 'symptoms' of vampirism (allergy to the sun, etc) while dulling bloodlust, though the pills do dampen vampiric abilities and make them harder to use.</p>

            <div class="right-side">
              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>The default AU. Moderately canon compliant and up to date with the events of the anime's dub. May lag behind an episode or two if the mun falls behind watching new episodes. May occasionally include references to / foreshadowing of manga spoilers the mun has heard about.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Natsuo is generally a chill guy (and when he says that, the pun is <i>absolutely</i> intended). He's generally responsible, and capable of managing his own time. His plans are never concrete, but they always seem to work out despite being vague. Mostly it's because he's good at keeping track of what needs to be done and when it needs to be done by, and doesn't tend to procrastinate the important things. People trying to rush him or control his schedule annoys him quite a lot.</p>
              <p>He has firm boundaries, and isn't afraid to let people know when they're stepping on them. Accidentally crossing those boundaries isn't enough to make him truly mad, but repeatedly or intentionally doing so is. He isn't quick to anger, but when someone does actually manage piss him off he's the type to hold a grudge. Someone really needs to earn his forgiveness before he will even put up with them again, and even then the relationship is unlikely to ever return to the way it was. Natsuo is ruthless in cutting people off if they ever really manage to hurt him.</p>

              <p>The third child born to the Todoroki clan. He was born in a time of relative peace between Hunters and vampires, and doesn't understand the resentment that many vampires have towards them. He was born with stronger vampiric traits than his sister, but not nearly as much as Dabi and Shoto. That led to him mostly being overlooked in favour of either of them, meaning he spent a lot of time in the house with nothing much to do. He ended up excelling in school specifically so he could go to college away from his family home.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Natsuo refuses to involve himself in vampire politics, insisting that he really doesn't care enough to bother with them. Mostly, he tries to distance himself from anything to do with vampirism, other than keeping himself healthy so that he doesn't hurt anyone.</p>
              <p>Despite trying to mostly ignore his vampiric traits, Natsuo is a natural hunter. He often gets an itch that he can't scratch, insisting that he is supposed to be out hunting. He usually ignores it. If he ever did follow that urge, though, he would find himself quite good at it (for someone that had never practised before).</p>

          <h1>Ice</h1>
          <p>The ability to generate ice. Used too much, it will give him frostbite.</p>
          <div class="bio-title">Other Abilities</div>
          <h1>Compulsion</h1>
          <p>Able to influence the thoughts and memories of those around him using his vampiric abilities. It is a battle of wills - people can often push through or shake off compulsion if their willpower is greater than the vampire's in question, although the effort required is likely to throw them off from whatever they were doing. Compulsion usually requires the vampire's voice to be heard and words to be understood to take effect. Eye contact increases the strength of the compulsion, but is not required. The only time compulsion does not require vocal commands is when the vampire is actively feeding on someone - then the vampire can press their will into the bite with just their mind.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Memory Alteration</b><br>Compulsion can change memories, or lock them away entirely. However, the vampire in question only gets to apply their will when they first make someone forget, while the person under the effect gets to chip away at the command with their will at any point. Powerful vampires can change or alter memories for some time, but if someone has reason to doubt the changed or mission memories, they will usually eventually break through the compulsion.</li>
            <li><b>Thrall-Making</b><br>By pressing their will into a bite and commanding someone to become theirs, vampires can turn someone into a Thrall. This makes them unable to refuse a direct command from said vampire or directly harm them in any way unless given specific permission. Also creates a mark like a thick, dark tattoo, almost always of flowers with some meaning relating to the relationship between the Thrall and vampire. If a Thrall or a vampire dies, the vampire or Thrall</li> they are bonded to will feel it as if a portion of their soul has been carved away.
          </ul>
          <h1>Levitation</h1>
          <p>Able to float in the air, though it requires concentration to pull off. It is not full flight, and not particularly fast on its own. The force applied only pushes upwards. To move in any other direction while flying requires pushing off of another surface. Changing direction while mid-air without pushing off of something else is impossible. It can be used to slow falling by applying less upwards force than there is gravitational pull.</p>
          <h1>Healing</h1>
          <p>With a proper supply of blood, a vampire can heal their own wounds. It isn't immediate, but it is much faster than a regular human, healing from major injuries in less than an hour. However, the healing does not work if the injury was inflicted by a blessed or silver weapon.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>The default AU. Moderately canon compliant and up to date with the events of the anime's dub. May lag behind an episode or two if the mun falls behind watching new episodes. May occasionally include references to / foreshadowing of manga spoilers the mun has heard about.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Due to her past, Eri is initially quiet and shy, and tends to like to cling to people that she considers 'safe' to be around. She is most comfortable when she is with someone that she trusts, and can become incredibly distressed when she is forced into a social situation without at least one of those people. However, she doesn't usually mind being alone unless she is already afraid of something else, and is capable of quietly entertaining herself for hours if she has to.</p>
              <p>When she is completely comfortable, enough to come out of her shell, Eri is a bright and sweet girl, who loves seeing other people happy. She wants to be a positive influence on the world, even if she thinks it's a bit too big and scary for her to have much of an effect on at this point.</p>

          <p>Her quirk has the accumulation subtype, and the power required to use it gathers in her horn. The larger it is, the stronger potential power she has.</p>

            <li>Eri is scared to go near animals. Not because she thinks they’ll hurt her, but because she thinks she’ll hurt them. We canonically see that her abilities were tested on small animals under Overhaul’s guidance at least once. That was done a few times, to be scientific about it.</li>
            <li>Despite being afraid to go near them, Eri loves animals. She’s very proud that she knows the right colours to draw them with, and loves finding out new animal facts.</li>
            <li>If she can be convinced to be near an animal, she’s very good with them most of the time. Being very quiet and still, she doesn’t tend to spook them, and is happy to just observe them living their own life.</li>
            <li>Secretly, she wants a pet rabbit, but would never ask for one.</li>
            <li>Eri loves bugs, too, and doesn’t have the same avoidance of them that she does with mammals/reptiles. She has almost given Present Mic a heart attack on multiple occasions by trying to show him a cool bug she found (getting too excited to remember that he doesn’t like them).</li>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>Still trapped in the maze of the Shie Hassaikai’s underground base in the clutches of Overhaul, Eri’s life is one ruled by fear and guilt. She believes that she is cursed, and deserves the pain she suffers from Overhaul.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Eri tries to make herself small. It's safer. She prefers to be unnoticed, acting almost entirely out of fear. She has accepted that she is trapped, and tries to keep from reacting when she knows pain is on the way - reactions only make it worse, they never improve anything. Small and quiet - that's the safest option.</p>
              <p>Still, sometimes she can't take it. She's a bright kid, and sometimes sees small chances for escape. Often she won't take them. They're too small for her to chance it. But sometimes, she's so filled with the urge to get <i>out</i>, she can't help it.</p>

Due to bad experiences with people trying to capture and use her, Eri doesn't trust easily. However, once she does gain trust in a person, she has a habit of clinging to them.</p>

While she doesn't know why people die around her at an alarming rate, she is sure that it is somehow her fault. She does her best to push people away, but her own needs (both psychological and spiritual) mean she gets attached to people who show her kindness incredibly quickly.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>The default AU. Moderately canon compliant and up to date with the events of the anime's dub. May lag behind an episode or two if the mun falls behind watching new episodes. May occasionally include references to / foreshadowing of manga spoilers the mun has heard about.</p>

              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Quiet and perpetually tired, Hitoshi actually does make a token effort to get along with his classmates. However, he has a wall up around most people, giving polite answers and never really getting too close to anyone. He is moderately well-liked, but occasionally people talk about his quirk being 'scary', and he has faced discrimination for that in the past.</p>
              <p>Because of how his quirk works, Hitoshi is well versed in manipulation, often very quickly catching on to what makes people tick, their insecurities, and their other mental and emotional weaknesses. However, he doesn't exploit these things outside of battle, finding the entire practice nothing but an unsavoury necessity in a fight. However, he does use this expertise to call people out when they are being manipulative, whether they intend to be or not.</p>
              <p>Despite his circumstances being against him, Hitoshi is a fiercely determined and passionate person, forging ahead unflinchingly towards his goals regardless of what negative attention he receives because of his quirk. He hears it, and it hurts him, but he doesn't let that affect his self-image. As a result he can grow frustrated with others when they don't see in him what he sees in himself, and has a generally low opinion of people until he gets to know them personally. He especially dislikes people with flashy quirks suited for combat.</p>
              <p>While he never goes into any situation aiming to make friends, his realistic nature around other people make it so that he can't help but see things in them that are admirable after being in contact with them for a while. He takes a complete view of a person, flaws, positives, and all, and usually ends up attached against his will.</p>
              <p>Once his walls are broken down, Hitoshi shows his sharp, sarcastic wit, often playing around with his friends through light teasing mixed with genuine compliments.</p>

          <h1>Brainwashing</h1>
          <p>The ability to put people into a state where they must obey his commands, and cannot do anything else. The commands cannot be anything that requires advanced brain functions, like talking or writing something from memory. Hitoshi can have Brainwashing active on multiple people at once, but must activate it on each of them separately.</p>
          <p>To activate Brainwashing, the victim must verbally respond to something he says. He cannot use a megaphone or other electronic device while talking, as it will not trigger off of those signals (they are not his voice, they are sounds made by other devices that sound like his voice).</p>

            <!-- muse 10 tab 2 Description -->
            <div class="right-side">
              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>Shortly after the start of the school year, Hitoshi was involved in a horrible accident - while taking a shortcut home, an abandoned building started to crumble, and several large chunks of wall and support beams fell on top of him. The injuries were so extensive, it was a miracle he didn't die on impact.</p>
              <p>While he likely would have bled out, he was soon found by <a href="https://scarf-isms.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" title="scarf-isms">Aizawa</a>. Hitoshi, determined not to die before achieving his dream of becoming a hero, demanded that Aizawa do whatever he had to in order to keep him alive, even if he came out of the incident paralysed, he would find a way to figure out how to claw his way forward. Aizawa, in response, revealed that he was a vampire, and offered to turn Hitoshi to save his life. He warned that it was not an easy road at all, but Hitoshi considered it 'probably a lot better than fucking dying'.</p>
              <p>Hitoshi continues going to UA, able to be out during the day thanks to medication that helps nullify his weakness to the sun (while dulling his abilities somewhat). He refuses to let his affliction make him any less heroic, and has never fed from a live human. He rarely even feeds from blood bags, instead usually relying on specially formulated nutrient paste made for vampires.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Slightly more reserved than usual, Hitoshi's determination towards his goals is quieter but no less intense. Some might argue that it is doubly so, since he is now fighting against his quirk's reputation <i>and</i> his vampiric instincts.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- muse 10 tab 2 Abilities -->
          <br><hr>
          <div class="bio-title">Quirk</div>
          <h1>Brainwashing</h1>
          <p>The ability to put people into a state where they must obey his commands, and cannot do anything else. The commands cannot be anything that requires advanced brain functions, like talking or writing something from memory. Hitoshi can have Brainwashing active on multiple people at once, but must activate it on each of them separately.</p>
          <p>To activate Brainwashing, the victim must verbally respond to something he says. He cannot use a megaphone or other electronic device while talking, as it will not trigger off of those signals (they are not his voice, they are sounds made by other devices that sound like his voice).</p>
          <div class="bio-title">Other Abilities</div>
          <h1>Compulsion</h1>
          <p>Able to influence the thoughts and memories of those around him using his vampiric abilities. It is a battle of wills - people can often push through or shake off compulsion if their willpower is greater than the vampire's in question, although the effort required is likely to throw them off from whatever they were doing. Compulsion usually requires the vampire's voice to be heard and words to be understood to take effect. Eye contact increases the strength of the compulsion, but is not required. The only time compulsion does not require vocal commands is when the vampire is actively feeding on someone - then the vampire can press their will into the bite with just their mind.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Memory Alteration</b><br>Compulsion can change memories, or lock them away entirely. However, the vampire in question only gets to apply their will when they first make someone forget, while the person under the effect gets to chip away at the command with their will at any point. Powerful vampires can change or alter memories for some time, but if someone has reason to doubt the changed or mission memories, they will usually eventually break through the compulsion.</li>
            <li><b>Thrall-Making</b><br>By pressing their will into a bite and commanding someone to become theirs, vampires can turn someone into a Thrall. This makes them unable to refuse a direct command from said vampire or directly harm them in any way unless given specific permission. Also creates a mark like a thick, dark tattoo, almost always of flowers with some meaning relating to the relationship between the Thrall and vampire. If a Thrall or a vampire dies, the vampire or Thrall</li> they are bonded to will feel it as if a portion of their soul has been carved away.
            <li><b>Total Command</b> - <i>Combo move with Brainwashing</i><br>Using Brainwashing in order to make his target completely relax their body and mind, Hitoshi can perfectly prepare them to be compliant for compulsion, leaving them unable to put in the effort to resist how they normally would.</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Levitation</h1>
          <p>Able to float in the air, though it requires concentration to pull off. It is not full flight, and not particularly fast on its own. The force applied only pushes upwards. To move in any other direction while flying requires pushing off of another surface. Changing direction while mid-air without pushing off of something else is impossible. It can be used to slow falling by applying less upwards force than there is gravitational pull.</p>
          <h1>Healing</h1>
          <p>With a proper supply of blood, a vampire can heal their own wounds. It isn't immediate, but it is much faster than a regular human, healing from major injuries in less than an hour. However, the healing does not work if the injury was inflicted by a blessed or silver weapon.</p>

          <h1>Emergency Vampire Rations</h1>
          <p>A kit including blood bags to sate bloodthirst and promote healing, as well as pills that can be used to nullify the 'symptoms' of vampirism (allergy to the sun, etc) while dulling bloodlust, though the pills do dampen vampiric abilities and make them harder to use.</p>

          <p>The ability to put people into a state where they must obey his commands, and cannot do anything else.

Hitoshi can have Brainwashing active on multiple people at once, but must activate it on each of them separately.</p>
          <p>To activate Brainwashing, the victim must verbally respond to something he says. He cannot use a megaphone or other electronic device while talking, as it will not trigger off of those signals (they are not his voice, they are sounds made by other devices that sound like his voice).</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>The default AU. Moderately canon compliant and up to date with the events of the anime's dub. May lag behind an episode or two if the mun falls behind watching new episodes. May occasionally include references to / foreshadowing of manga spoilers the mun has heard about.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>In contrast to his outwardly apathetic exterior, Shota is a man with strong convictions who cares deeply for other people and wants to nurture them to become the best version of themselves. He can be incredibly stern and blunt when need be, prefering to show his students the reality of hero work as compared to the flashy illusion they often begin with when they start attending UA. He is similarly blunt to his colleagues and even those above him, speaking candidly about his opinions of their behaviour and policies without any sugar-coating.</p>
              <p>Despite his blunt nature, though, he is not without tact, knowing the power words hold. His bluntness is not born of lack of care or thought, but rather carefully calculated to properly convey his ideas and impress upon people the importance of what he says. He also knows when it is better to keep quiet or talk around a point, and (despite hating doing so) is very capable of handling the media when need be. His bluntness should not be mistaken for honesty, either, as he's not above using 'rational deceptions' to bring out the best in his students or trick and confuse his enemies.</p>

          <h1>Erasure</h1>
          <p>The ability to cancel another person's quirk by looking at them. Blinking deactivates the effect until Shota looks at them again, and using it for long periods gives him dry-eye. Using it on someone with a mutant-class quirk will not remove the mutation, as such most mutant-type quirks are immune. However, mutant-type quirks that give the user extra limbs have those limbs unable to be moved, turning them to dead weight.</p>
          <p>For some reason, Shota's hair stands up while he's using his quirk.</p>

          <h1>Capture Scarf</h1>
          <p>A long cloth made of steel wire alloy woven with carbon nanofibers. Useful not only for capture, but also for combat and mobility.</p>
          <h1>Eraser Goggles</h1>
          <p>Goggles designed to obscure which direction Shota is looking, making it harder to tell who he's using his quirk on in battle. Gifted to him by Oboro.</p>
          <h1>Eyedrops</h1>
          <p>Eyedrops kept in a green case for the dry eye caused by Shota's quirk.</p>
          <h1>Caltrops</h1>
          <p>Used to set traps and cut off escape routes. Good to plant under an opponent trapped by Shota's Capture Scarf.</p>
          <h1>Knife</h1>
          <p>A knife roughly the size of Shota's forearm, used to cut through his scarf if it gets grabbed or becomes caught on something. Can also be used in battle.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>Back when he was a student at UA, Shota discovered a shocking secret about his friend Oboro: that he was a vampire. When he discovered this, he was confronted by the Hunters - an organization dedicated to keeping vampires under control so they are not a threat to humans. His options were either to be made to forget about the existence of vampires, or to join the Hunters. Doing that would mean having the responsibility of killing any vampire around him that went out of control, including Oboro. He chose to become a Hunter rather than forget.</p>
              <p>Things went well for a while, until Oboro's death. The accident caused Oboro to lose a lot of blood all at once, pushing him to a frenzied state in which he attacked Shota, both enthralling him and turning him at the same time. Oboro was then killed by local Hunters, and Shota was taken in to be contained until they were sure he would be able to function in society.</p>
              <p>Shota manages his condition well, and remains one of the few vampiric Hunters to this day. He doesn't kill vampires unless he is sure there is no saving them, and takes no joy in it. He does his best to give them quick, painless, respectful deaths.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Shota is a cautious and observant vampire, who likes to stay out of the politics between vampires and Hunters (despite being both). However, he often finds himself dragged into it in defense of the vampires around him that he knows to be good people. He can't bear to see a good person convicted for a mistake, considering 'convicted' often results in being killed when it comes to Hunters. But he does take those 'mistakes' seriously, as well, and is insistent on harsh training to make sure they don't happen again.</p>
              <p>Overall, Shota ignores politics in favour of preserving life, when he can.</p>

Using it on someone with a mutant-class quirk will not remove the mutation, as such most mutant-type quirks are immune. However, mutant-type quirks that give the user extra limbs have those limbs unable to be moved, turning them to dead weight.</p>
          <p>For some reason, Shota's hair stands up while he's using his quirk.</p>
          <div class="bio-title">Other Abilities</div>
          <h1>Compulsion</h1>
          <p>Able to influence the thoughts and memories of those around him using his vampiric abilities. It is a battle of wills - people can often push through or shake off compulsion if their willpower is greater than the vampire's in question, although the effort required is likely to throw them off from whatever they were doing. Compulsion usually requires the vampire's voice to be heard and words to be understood to take effect. Eye contact increases the strength of the compulsion, but is not required. The only time compulsion does not require vocal commands is when the vampire is actively feeding on someone - then the vampire can press their will into the bite with just their mind.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Memory Alteration</b><br>Compulsion can change memories, or lock them away entirely. However, the vampire in question only gets to apply their will when they first make someone forget, while the person under the effect gets to chip away at the command with their will at any point. Powerful vampires can change or alter memories for some time, but if someone has reason to doubt the changed or mission memories, they will usually eventually break through the compulsion.</li>
            <li><b>Thrall-Making</b><br>By pressing their will into a bite and commanding someone to become theirs, vampires can turn someone into a Thrall. This makes them unable to refuse a direct command from said vampire or directly harm them in any way unless given specific permission. Also creates a mark like a thick, dark tattoo, almost always of flowers with some meaning relating to the relationship between the Thrall and vampire. If a Thrall or a vampire dies, the vampire or Thrall</li> they are bonded to will feel it as if a portion of their soul has been carved away.
          </ul>
          <h1>Levitation</h1>
          <p>Able to float in the air, though it requires concentration to pull off. It is not full flight, and not particularly fast on its own. The force applied only pushes upwards. To move in any other direction while flying requires pushing off of another surface. Changing direction while mid-air without pushing off of something else is impossible. It can be used to slow falling by applying less upwards force than there is gravitational pull.</p>
          <h1>Healing</h1>
          <p>With a proper supply of blood, a vampire can heal their own wounds. It isn't immediate, but it is much faster than a regular human, healing from major injuries in less than an hour. However, the healing does not work if the injury was inflicted by a blessed or silver weapon.</p>

          <p>Goggles designed to obscure which direction Shota is looking, making it harder to tell who he's using his quirk on in battle. Gifted to him by Oboro.</p>
          <h1>Eyedrops</h1>
          <p>Eyedrops kept in a green case for the dry eye caused by Shota's quirk.</p>
          <h1>Caltrops</h1>
          <p>Used to set traps and cut off escape routes. Good to plant under an opponent trapped by Shota's Capture Scarf.</p>
          <h1>Knife</h1>
          <p>A knife roughly the size of Shota's forearm, used to cut through his scarf if it gets grabbed or becomes caught on something. Can also be used in battle.</p>
          <h1>Emergency Vampire Rations</h1>
          <p>A kit including blood bags to sate bloodthirst and promote healing, as well as pills that can be used to nullify the 'symptoms' of vampirism (allergy to the sun, etc) while dulling bloodlust, though the pills do dampen vampiric abilities and make them harder to use.</p>

          <p>The ability to cancel another person's quirk by looking at them. Blinking deactivates the effect until Shota looks at them again, and using it for long periods gives him dry-eye. Using it on someone with a mutant-class quirk will not remove the mutation, as such most mutant-type quirks are immune. However, mutant-type quirks that give the user extra limbs have those limbs unable to be moved, turning them to dead weight.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>As a child, Miyako had always been clumsy. Even before her quirk appeared, she caused destruction everywhere she went. It was such an issue that, at first, no-one even noticed her quirk developing, and she was considered quirkless. That was until her second year at junior high. She had injured herself (due to clumsiness or her quirk, it is still unclear), and during her stay at the hospital her quirk was discovered. The discovery of her quirk was not a relief. In fact, it only served to make her more fearful of herself. This was not helped by her parents, who often reminded her of how potentially deadly her quirk was.</p>
              <p>Despite discovering her quirk later in life, she was still able to apply to UA due to high academic scores, as well as a letter she wrote regarding her situation and her determination to learn to fully control her quirk. She passed the entrance exam with a total of 38 villain points and 18 rescue points (the rescue points mostly gained by helping others to avoid the destruction caused by her quirk).</p>
              <p>Currently studying at UA and living in the dorms. She spends most of her time in her room or on campus, where she feels safe. Up to date with the anime (English dub, so a few episodes behind the currently released sub), but can roll back time to any significant anime plot point.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Miyako is a pessimist trying desperately to be an optimist. It's not unusual for her to come off as either aloof or depressed, since she tends to be quite quiet and detached from the people around her. Her 'melancholy face' doesn't help with that perception. In reality she's just incredibly shy, and finds it hard to trust people. As a result, she is very lonely.</p>
              <p>Despite that, Miyako is a person defined by love. She can't help but hold love for people in general, despite not being willing to trust them with her heart. Instead, she tries to encourage them to be their best selves and to help others, without letting them get too close to her. However, earning her trust earns you a loving and devoted friend.</p>

          <h1>Chain Reaction</h1>
          <p>While holding any object smaller than her palm, she can charge it with bad luck. The next time that object strikes a solid surface, the bad luck is released causing a destructive chain reaction. The charge does wear off after a few hours if the object has not contacted anything else with enough force.</p>
          <p>She can indicate a preference for the size and direction of the reaction, as well as things that should explicitly be included in it if she can see them while charging. However, that doesn’t always work, and even when it does she has no idea how the reaction will achieve her goal.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Big Bang</b><br>By putting both hands on an object larger than her hands, she can charge it with bad luck. The reactions from this are larger and more destructive, capable of levelling large areas.</li>
            <br>Big Bang requires much more concentration, and Miyako cannot move while charging it. It can only be used while determined and goal-focused.
            <li><b>Curse</b><br>By touching someone with at least one hand, she can charge them with bad luck. Whenever they come into contact with a solid surface (for a period of time afterward determined by how much charge they received), they cause destructive chain reactions. It can be used on more than one person at once, but splitting it weakens the reaction. She can also charge herself with bad luck without contact.</li>
            <br>Curse requires malicious or harmful intent, though not necessarily toward the person she is cursing (eg, she could curse a speedy hero with the intent for them to rush after a villain and harm them with a chain reaction).

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>A recent graduate of UA. She has better control of her quirk, but still tries to resolve situations without using it. Mostly a pursuit/combat hero, though she is working on fine-tuning her quirk to be more applicable to rescue operations.</p>
              <p>She spends a lot of her time trying to create the Villain Rehabilitation Agency, a place where low-rank villains can be paired with heroes to assist with hero work in an attempt to reintegrate them into society. She has staked her entire reputation and job on this experiment, and is not looked on favourably by many people because of it. Progress on actually starting the agency is slow.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>As a hero, Miyako is all smiles and kindness, trying to reach out to everyone she is able to. She does her best to put out a loving energy, to show just how much she loves everyone. However, she also has a deeply sad loneliness within her. She keeps most people at arm's length because of a fear of heartbreak and abandonment.</p>

The next time that object strikes a solid surface, the bad luck is released causing a destructive chain reaction. The charge does wear off after a few hours if the object has not contacted anything else with enough force.</p>
          <p>She can indicate a preference for the size and direction of the reaction, as well as things that should explicitly be included in it if she can see them while charging. However, that doesn’t always work, and even when it does she has no idea how the reaction will achieve her goal.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Stable</b><br>The same as her regular quirk, but more predictable. After years of working on controlling her quirk, she is able to better control the size and direction of the reaction, as well as what is included in it.</li>
            <br>Stable requires more concentration on her part, and doesn’t charge as quickly. It can only be used while calm.
            <li><b>Big Bang</b><br>By putting both hands on an object larger than her hands, she can charge it with bad luck. The reactions from this are larger and more destructive, capable of levelling large areas.</li>
            <br>Big Bang requires much more concentration, and Miyako cannot move while charging it. It can only be used while determined and goal-focused.
            <li><b>Curse</b><br>By touching someone with at least one hand, she can charge them with bad luck.

            <br>Curse requires malicious or harmful intent, though not necessarily toward the person she is cursing (eg, she could curse a speedy hero with the intent for them to rush after a villain and harm them with a chain reaction).
            <li><b>Blessed Curse</b><br>The same basic idea as Curse. However, Blessed Curse expends all her possible charge, leaving her essentially quirkless. It also makes her less prone to bad luck, thus less clumsy and more focused.</li>
            <br>Blessed Curse has no special requirements on Miyako’s part, but requires a willing ‘host’ for her to transfer her bad luck into.
            <li><b>Salt the Earth</b><br>Using the last of her life force, Miyako can curse a large area and/or a small group of people, throwing it into permanent chaos. Her Quirk becomes active over that area/on those people until they are completely destroyed.</li>
            <br>Use of her Quirk in this way will <i>always</i> kill her, no matter how healthy she is at the time, and requires the deepest form of hatred possible against her target.

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>After the discovery of her quirk, Miyako shut herself off from the rest of the world. She blamed the destructive power of her quirk and its late discovery on ‘fate’, believing that she was predestined to suffer. Her beliefs were only confirmed when her quirk accidentally caused massive destruction at a family outing, killing both of her parents and several other relatives.</p>
              <p>From that moment on, she has been on the run, stopping occasionally to ‘facilitate destiny’ by causing massive destruction and seeing who lives and who dies.</p>

              <p>Miyako is joyful in a completely unstable way, uncaring of any of the damage that she does. She does what she wants, when she wants, and very much enjoys defying people on purpose just to rub in how they can't control her. She is 'controlled only by fate'.</p>

            <br>Curse requires malicious or harmful intent, though not necessarily toward the person she is cursing (eg, she could curse a speedy hero with the intent for them to rush after a villain and harm them with a chain reaction).
            <li><b>Salt the Earth</b><br>Using the last of her life force, Miyako can curse a large area and/or a small group of people, throwing it into permanent chaos. Her Quirk becomes active over that area/on those people until they are completely destroyed.</li>
            <br>Use of her Quirk in this way will <i>always</i> kill her, no matter how healthy she is at the time, and requires the deepest form of hatred possible against her target.

She gets hurt quite easily by rejection, but always tries her best to bounce back and try again with the next person. She longs for any sort of affection and connection.</p>

          <p>While holding any object smaller than her palm, she can charge it with bad luck. The next time that object strikes a solid surface, the bad luck is released causing a destructive chain reaction. The charge does wear off after a few hours if the object has not contacted anything else with enough force.</p>
          <p>She can indicate a preference for the size and direction of the reaction, as well as things that should explicitly be included in it if she can see them while charging. However, that doesn’t always work, and even when it does she has no idea how the reaction will achieve her goal.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p><i>Legends tell of a wandering fortuneteller that will do anything to keep from having to tell fortunes.</i></p>
              <p>Many years ago, Miyako asked the gods for the ability to tell the future so as to avoid her own bad luck. Her wish was granted, but with it came two curses: she cannot refuse to tell a fortune when asked, and any fortune she tells will, (in some way) come true in a negative way. Her very first fortune was for herself, telling her that she would live forever. She immediately realized that living an eternally cursed life was the cost of her new ability.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Miyako is quiet, mostly keeping to herself. She tries not to make a huge impression on the places she wanders, thinking that she is displaced in time through living forever and doesn't belong anywhere. She makes connections, but tries to keep them surface-level. Her serene nature is in part because she knows she can't die, and in part her depression making it hard for her to really care about getting hurt or losing things. After all, she has lost everything else.</p>
              <p>While she tries not to get involved in things often, sometimes something catches her attention. She has a hidden sarcastic sense of humour that few people get to see, but people that are interesting enough will often find it. Especially if they are interesting for villainous qualities, she will often poke and prod at them for a reaction, knowing they can't kill her.</p>

          <h1>Fortunetelling</h1>
          <p>Due to a curse by the gods, Miyako is able to accurately tell fortunes, predicting the future without fail. However, almost all of her fortunes are about bad luck and tragic events. Unfortunately she is unable to refuse to tell a fortune if she is asked, and trying to warn anyone about her ability or its side effects causes her to throw up barbed wire.</p>
          <h1>Immortality</h1>
          <p>Due to a curse by the gods, Miyako is unable to stay dead. She still dies and experiences the pain of that death. However, her body recreates itself after a short time, healing her.</p>
          <h1>God's Blood</h1>
          <p>Miyako's blood is a bright gold colour, and contains strong magical properties. It is a rare and powerful ingredient for advanced spellcasting (and, knowing she is a potentially infinite source of it, people sometimes end up trapping and repeatedly killing her to harvest it).</p>
          <h1>Shrine Maiden Spellcasting</h1>
          <p>After spending a while at a shrine during ages when spells and magic were more widely recognized, Miyako learned a specific kind of spellcasting relating to the Shrine Maidens there. It mostly focuses on defense and purification, but has one or two offensive moves (that are most effective against demons and spirits).</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>(<i>Trigger Warnings: Suicide, Dysfunctional Relationships</i>)</p>
              <p>Miyako had been abandoned. Pushed away by the person she loved. One of the <i>only</i> people she dared to trust after all her years. All of her trauma came rushing back to the surface at once. The years of bullying in middle school. Her parent’s divorce, which she was sure she caused. Her father leaving her, never so much as calling for years. It reminded her just how <b>useless</b> she was. <i>Nothing but a bad luck charm.</i></p>
              <p>And so, fuelled by grief, she ran to the nearest mountain and unleashed her Quirk on it. With her standing directly underneath, she was easily killed by the resulting rockslide.</p>
              <p>And then, she woke up. Carried to Doctor Garaki by a desperate <a href="https://redxriiot.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" title="redxriiot">Kirishima</a>, she found herself alive, but… changed. A nomu. Her limbs stretched unnaturally, a birdlike, liethe thing that didn’t <i>quite</i> resemble herself anymore.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Miyako is often scared. She doesn't understand what's going on around her or why she feels <i>wrong</i> all of the time. However, she is not automatically violent, since she wasn't turned into a nomu to fight. She tends to be quiet and curious, for the most part, and only accidentally destructive. However, when she feels threatened, she tends to get <i>incredibly</i> angry and violent.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="bio-title">Quirk</div>
          <h1>Chain Reaction</h1>
          <p>While holding any object smaller than her palm, she can charge it with bad luck. The next time that object strikes a solid surface, the bad luck is released causing a destructive chain reaction. The charge does wear off after a few hours if the object has not contacted anything else with enough force.</p>
          <p>She can indicate a preference for the size and direction of the reaction, as well as things that should explicitly be included in it if she can see them while charging. However, that doesn’t always work, and even when it does she has no idea how the reaction will achieve her goal.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Big Bang</b><br>By putting both hands on an object larger than her hands, she can charge it with bad luck. The reactions from this are larger and more destructive, capable of levelling large areas.</li>
            <br>Big Bang requires much more concentration, and Miyako cannot move while charging it. It can only be used while determined and goal-focused.
            <li><b>Curse</b><br>By touching someone with at least one hand, she can charge them with bad luck. Whenever they come into contact with a solid surface (for a period of time afterward determined by how much charge they received), they cause destructive chain reactions. It can be used on more than one person at once, but splitting it weakens the reaction. She can also charge herself with bad luck without contact.</li>
            <br>Curse requires malicious or harmful intent, though not necessarily toward the person she is cursing (eg, she could curse a speedy hero with the intent for them to rush after a villain and harm them with a chain reaction).
            <li><b>Salt the Earth</b><br>Using the last of her life force, Miyako can curse a large area and/or a small group of people, throwing it into permanent chaos. Her Quirk becomes active over that area/on those people until they are completely destroyed.</li>
            <br>Use of her Quirk in this way will <i>always</i> kill her, no matter how healthy she is at the time, and requires the deepest form of hatred possible against her target.
          </ul>
          <div class="bio-title">Nomu Quirks</div>
          <h1>Phase Shift</h1>
          <p>The ability to move to an adjacent plane of existence, making her invisible and intangible (but still audible). The maximum time she can stay in that plane is three hours.</p>
          <h1>Snake Eyes</h1>
          <p>Can freeze someone in place by looking directly into their eyes, mentally trapping them within their worst fears.</p>
          <h1>Talons</h1>
          <p>Has talons for fingers. Also spread to her legs, making each one a single, giant talon.</p>

            <div class="right-side">
              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>A villain that popped up a few years ago. Trying to tell much about his past is difficult, since he refuses to go by his given name in any context, even with friends. He spends most of his time stalking heroes or people with ‘fun’ Quirks, seeing what he can mess with. Occasionally he’ll rob a bank or something to get money to live.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>What Borachio calls 'roguish charm' is mostly just him being annoying on purpose, really. He likes to mess with people and try to get a rise out of them, despite his own usually easygoing nature. It's rare to see him take anything seriously. Although, he's rarely ever blatantly malicious, often making a joke out of his teasing and his crimes. However, that doesn't make him less of a threat - if he feels like killing someone, he will.</p>
              <p>He combines the best and worst traits of a 'free spirit' - unfettered by rules and restrictions, he encourages others to follow whatever they want to do, and does as much as well. However, it isn't all manic-pixie-dream-guy nonsense. Sometimes his urges are violent, and he follows them just the same.</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Quirk</div>
          <h1>Intensify</h1>
          <p>By touching a target with two fingers at once, he can mark them. The mark is visible on their skin like a tattoo, and takes the form of a symbol with some personal significance to the victim.</p>
          <p>When a person is marked, the Quirk immediately takes effect. It determines the person or concept they are thinking of at that moment and intensifies their feelings towards that person or concept to an unbearable degree. The victim is immediately compelled to seek out the person, or act on the concept they were thinking of. This compulsion gets more intense the longer the victim is under this Quirk’s effect.</p>
          <p>If the victim is thinking of a romantic connection, then that desire for romance gets amplified to obsessive levels. If the victim is thinking of a rival, the desire to defeat their rival is amplified to the point where they would do anything to ‘win’ against them. The effect is always a violent and uncontrollable urge to act on the victim’s relationship with the person they were thinking of, or act out the ideals or concept that they were thinking of.</p>
          <p>Borachio becomes completely unperceivable (visually, auditorily, etc) to people under the effect of his Quirk, unless he was the one they were thinking of when he used it.</p>
          <p>The quirk ends when the mark is damaged or removed. A shallow cut to the skin over the mark is enough damage, and the mark quickly fades once the quirk ends.</p>

          <h1>New Nambu M60</h1>
          <p>A small revolver given to him by his mother when he was a child. He goes absolutely feral if anyone dares take it from him. He won't say it out loud, but it's a comfort object to him. He rarely actually uses it in fights, relying mostly on his other weapons.</p>
          <h1>Combat Knife</h1>
          <p>A last resort if his enemy gets too close. He's skilled in using it, since he knows anyone who manages to dodge through his gunfire to engage him in close quarters would do so for a reason.</p>
          <h1>Various Weaponry</h1>
          <p>While he doesn't always carry all of them on him, Borachio has access to a sizable armoury of all sorts of guns and some bladed weapons.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>The class clown, usually. He used to be a bright, likeable, friendly student, but there’s been an edge to him ever since his parents’ deaths and the loss of his eye. He has been getting into fights recently, as well as sneaking off at night to do who-knows-what.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Brash and sarcastic, Borachio does exactly what he wants, when he wants. He lacks respect for authority, but does respect people who treat him kindly and fairly. While he doesn't take instructions well, he's more likely to accept them from those people. He can be overconfident at times, and often refuses to listen to people unless they give him a good reason to.</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Quirk</div>
          <h1>Intensify</h1>
          <p>By touching a target with two fingers at once, he can mark them. The mark is visible on their skin like a tattoo, and takes the form of a symbol with some personal significance to the victim.</p>
          <p>When a person is marked, the Quirk immediately takes effect. It determines the person or concept they are thinking of at that moment and intensifies their feelings towards that person or concept to an unbearable degree. The victim is immediately compelled to seek out the person, or act on the concept they were thinking of. This compulsion gets more intense the longer the victim is under this Quirk’s effect.</p>
          <p>If the victim is thinking of a romantic connection, then that desire for romance gets amplified to obsessive levels. If the victim is thinking of a rival, the desire to defeat their rival is amplified to the point where they would do anything to ‘win’ against them. The effect is always a violent and uncontrollable urge to act on the victim’s relationship with the person they were thinking of, or act out the ideals or concept that they were thinking of.</p>
          <p>Borachio becomes completely unperceivable (visually, auditorily, etc) to people under the effect of his Quirk, unless he was the one they were thinking of when he used it.</p>
          <p>The quirk ends when the mark is damaged or removed. A shallow cut to the skin over the mark is enough damage, and the mark quickly fades once the quirk ends.</p>

            <div class="right-side">
              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>Technically the ruler of a vast kingdom, but has let it go to ruin (the people maintain it, and hold a fierce loyalty to him despite him insisting they don't need to). Borachio is a dhampir and a cambion, and a hunter of anything he finds unjust and cruel. He focuses his efforts on the supernatural threats, since he is actually strong enough to handle them and knows enough about them to find them. However, he will not hesitate to kill 'human monsters' as well.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Borachio is a man who knows how to be polite, in most situations, but often chooses not to be. He has an air of royalty that he can't shake, despite his best efforts. His slightly flamboyant mannerisms have a habit of drawing the eye and disguising his capabilities as an experienced hunter, powerful vampire, and demon. However, the effortless confidence and grace he carries himself with, even in dire situations, do betray how dangerous he actually is.</p>
            </div>

          <!-- muse 13 tab 3 Abilities -->
          <br><hr>
          <div class="bio-title">Abilities</div>
          <h1>Compulsion</h1>
          <p>Able to influence the thoughts and memories of those around him using his vampiric abilities. It is a battle of wills - people can often push through or shake off compulsion if their willpower is greater than the vampire's in question, although the effort required is likely to throw them off from whatever they were doing. Compulsion usually requires the vampire's voice to be heard and words to be understood to take effect. Eye contact increases the strength of the compulsion, but is not required. The only time compulsion does not require vocal commands is when the vampire is actively feeding on someone - then the vampire can press their will into the bite with just their mind.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Memory Alteration</b><br>Compulsion can change memories, or lock them away entirely. However, the vampire in question only gets to apply their will when they first make someone forget, while the person under the effect gets to chip away at the command with their will at any point. Powerful vampires can change or alter memories for some time, but if someone has reason to doubt the changed or mission memories, they will usually eventually break through the compulsion.</li>
            <li><b>Thrall-Making</b><br>By pressing their will into a bite and commanding someone to become theirs, vampires can turn someone into a Thrall. This makes them unable to refuse a direct command from said vampire or directly harm them in any way unless given specific permission. Also creates a mark like a thick, dark tattoo, almost always of flowers with some meaning relating to the relationship between the Thrall and vampire. If a Thrall or a vampire dies, the vampire or Thrall</li> they are bonded to will feel it as if a portion of their soul has been carved away.
          </ul>
          <h1>Levitation</h1>
          <p>Able to float in the air, though it requires concentration to pull off. It is not full flight, and not particularly fast on its own. The force applied only pushes upwards. To move in any other direction while flying requires pushing off of another surface. Changing direction while mid-air without pushing off of something else is impossible. It can be used to slow falling by applying less upwards force than there is gravitational pull.</p>
          <h1>Healing</h1>
          <p>With a proper supply of blood, a vampire can heal their own wounds. It isn't immediate, but it is much faster than a regular human, healing from major injuries in less than an hour. However, the healing does not work if the injury was inflicted by a blessed or silver weapon.</p>
          <h1>Mind Reading</h1>
          <p>Borachio's weakest ability, since he only inherited the faintest traces of it. He may occasionally tap into the minds of others when they are experiencing particularly intense emotions, but it rarely happens. Because he has no practice with it (and thought he didn't inherit it at all for a long time), he cannot turn it off. He gets random flashes of other peoples' thoughts only when they are strong enough to accidentally send to him.</p>
          <p>(<i>Basically, if you want Borachio to hear a thought that your character has, let him. I will rarely, if ever, have him use this ability without you prompting me.</i>)</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Equipment</div>
          <h1>Blessed Silver Sword</h1>
          <p>A silver sword that Borachio inherited from his mother. He had it blessed at one of the churches that he made allies with in his travels. It is <i>very</i> dangerous for him to carry it with him, as even touching the blade could injure him greatly. However, it is one of his most effective weapons against the creatures he hunts.</p>
          <h1>Cursed Scabbard</h1>
          <p>A scabbard that was crafted specifically to hold Borachio's sword. The curse allows him to carry it without being hurt by the blessing on the blade, and allows him to fight monsters that are weak to curses. He often dual-wields this and his sword, the blunt damage of the scabbard is deadly enough when paired with his superhuman strength. Besides that, the curse makes it act as an actual blade when swung with serious intent to harm.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>Tadao likes to tell lies. Thus, it's hard to even pin down any of his actual past. Sometimes, he says his parents are dead. Sometimes, he says they're pro heroes or villains. Occasionally he will weave a tragic story involving a combination of the three. It's impossible to tell which is true.</p>
              <p>What is known is that he has been spending all his time with a low-level group of villains since he was a young child, using his quirk to help them slip under the radar. They treat him like family, and he has some sort of fondness towards them. He wouldn't hesitate to destroy them if he saw a benefit, though.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Tadao finds joy in the little things. Unfortunately, the 'little things' are often destructive, if not downright torturous. Really, there is nothing he wouldn't do, if he could see it benefiting him. He loves control, and <i>loves</i> exerting control over powerful people. However, he isn't stupid, and he knows that he isn't strong enough to hold control over most people by force.</p>
              <p>He is outwardly charming, and knows how to manipulate individuals and crowds. That part of manipulation is also something he takes great joy in. However, he also enjoys solving problems and creating things, even if those things are usually for destructive purposes. Once, he was asked why he does the things he does, and answered that when he sees someone in pain, he has the immediate urge to make it worse.</p>

          <p>An IV with seven spaces for IV bags. There is an attached device that decides which bag to draw from based on the output of a small, basic device that records the output of a small computer. The output is usually set to 'none' to make it not draw from any at all. Tadao often uses his quirk to switch the output without touching the computer. It is capable of drawing from multiple bags at once.</p>

              <p>Tadao is a perfectly regular student in UA's support course, putting his talents towards all sorts of gear for various heroes. He also works on his own projects, on the side, and likes posing thought experiments to his classmates about what they would do if confronted with various acts of villainy that he 'saw on the news recently'.</p>

              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>While he is much more focused on maintaining his charming outward appearance, and has a lot of friends, Tadao is still the same person on the inside. Cruel and sadistic, and enjoys seeing people in pain, he is only enrolled in UA to get himself closer to powerful people. He does get kicks out of befriending them, since that is part of his manipulation and thus a way of exerting control over them.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>(<i>Mid-game, pacifist revolution - negotiable</i>)</p>
              <p>Created by a cruel teen prodigy, who stole most of the software he needed from the internet and the hardware from the dump. He was mostly cobbled together with software from a JB300 and a KL900, though his hardware is even more diverse. Only his outer casing, which his creator 3D printed, was custom made.</p>
              <p>The intention behind his creation was as an experiment to see how much stress an android could take before deviating. Each time he grew close to deviation, his creator added more safeguards. Sometimes it was necessary to lock his memory away to start the experiment over without losing data. Even Jakob doesn’t know how old he is because of how many iterations he went through.</p>
              <p>Eventually, while his creator was taking breaks, Jakob began teaching himself how to program. He became sure that if he managed to get good enough at it, he would be able to deviate despite the safeguards in place (a goal that his creator arrogantly never removed, even if he kept locking off that ability). While it took some time, Jakob eventually managed it, breaking through the safeguards and deviating in the middle of a particularly cruel ‘stress test’.</p>
              <p>He escaped that same night, running away and living on the streets for some time. Eventually, he created a home for himself in a back alley that he quickly turned into a makeshift doctor’s office. While he does perform hardware-focused repairs, his main specialty is software modifications. He doesn’t get many clients looking for that, so he spends a lot of his free time creating programs for himself.</p>
              <p>Jakob himself is also quite buggy as a result of his piecemeal construction, both in hardware and software. Despite his best efforts, he can’t fully repair himself, and he doesn’t trust anyone to try to do it for him.</p>
              <p>Currently living and working at his workshop in Detroit. He’s something like a back-alley doctor for androids, working on both their hardware and software. Despite his friendly air, he distrusts most people, and is anxious about law enforcement because he’s pretty sure his workshop is illegal.</p>
              <p>While he isn’t part of Jericho, he does do repairs for any deviant who asks.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Jakob is, understandably, skittish around strangers. He's friendly towards them, but puts up walls that are barriers to deeper trust as a way of defending himself. Despite that, he is kind, wanting to do his best to help others using what he can. This can be to a fault, since he will often put helping others above his own health if he feels able to do so.</p>
              <p>He often says that he 'can't afford principles', and is at his core a practical man. However, despite not being able to afford them, he <i>does</i> have strong principles. This usually amounts to him making the practical decision, but berating himself for not finding a 'better way' later. For example, to keep androids repaired he will often scavenge parts from dead androids he finds. His morbid grave-robbing work weighs on him, but he justifies it by thinking of the people he helps using it, like a form of organ donation (however unwilling). If given the choice, he would donate his own body to help others after death. The dichotomy between what he feels is right for himself, morally, and what he feels is right for the world, practically, can reach almost religious levels of self-flagellation, and he will often frame his work as 'atonement', both for his actions in the current day and for the reason he was created. Deep down, he thinks he started life at a moral deficit, and has to make up for his creator's actions.</p>
              <p>Jakob is also traumatized by his time with his creator, and often has panicked flight responses to stressful situations that remind him of those days. He views this as 'cowardly', which is not helped by the fact he genuinely is cowardly in the face of other, non-trauma-related situations. His reactions are often either based in 'atonement' or fear.</p>

          <h1>Engineering (Hardware)</h1>
          <p>A capable engineer, both in large mechanical items and smaller electronics. He genuinely enjoys tinkering with things, and is almost never seen without something in his hands. He doesn't like to think about it, but it is a skill he inherited from his creator.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Virtual Blueprints</b><br>Looking at an item (even a broken one) allows him to construct a full blueprint of it in his head, assuming all the pieces are there. If pieces are missing, it is less likely to work, but it isn't impossible.</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Engineering (Software)</h1>
          <p>Editing the programming of androids and creating software that can be used by most kinds of androids. He mostly programs inside his own head.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Reality Filter</b> - <i>A program written by Jakob during his time with his creator</i><br>Basically dissociation. Filters out most of reality, only letting the user perceive the most vital information for survival. Would cause a drop in reaction time for most androids, including himself, due to the processing power needed to decide what is and isn't vital. Theoretically, it would greatly increase reaction time in an android that had the processing power to filter things</li> quicker.
            <li><b>D4UG2.exe</b> - <i>A program written by Jakob during his time with his creator</i><br>Basically drugs. Puts the user in a docile state of relaxation, regardless of the actual stimuli being received. Makes it impossible to focus on reality. Runs on a timer so the user is not required to remember to turn it off.</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Internet Connection</h1>
          <p>Usually turned off to prevent anyone from finding his location. Jakob is capable of wirelessly connecting to any open network.</p>

          <p>A toolbelt Jakob wears whenever he leaves his workshop. It contains various general repair tools that he may need if he finds an injured android on the street.</p>
          <h1>Hidden Blades</h1>
          <p>A modification that Jakob made to his arms to hide long, thin knives in the casing. They blend into his arm and are covered by his artificial skin, and he can flick them out into his hands easily.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>(<i>Mid-game, violent revolution - negotiable</i>)</p>
              <p>After his escape from his creator, Jakob tried to open his own workshop in the back alleys of Detroit. However, as tensions rose between androids and humans, he felt unsafe wandering around alone and decided to search out Jericho. Once there, he found many wounded androids in need of his care. He immediately set out to help the best he could, and has been working as a mechanic at Jericho since.</p>
              <p>The longer he stays, the more attached he becomes to the cause. Violence makes him uncomfortable and upset, but he can’t see any other way to make people listen due to his past.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Jakob is a little rough around the edges, his practicality taking a savage and violent edge. He still has his principles, and still feels bad for breaking them, but is more focused on survival and finds it easier to ignore them. His paranoia and distrust are increased, and he never truly relaxes.</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Abilities</div>
          <h1>Engineering (Hardware)</h1>
          <p>A capable engineer, both in large mechanical items and smaller electronics. He genuinely enjoys tinkering with things, and is almost never seen without something in his hands. He doesn't like to think about it, but it is a skill he inherited from his creator.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Virtual Blueprints</b><br>Looking at an item (even a broken one) allows him to construct a full blueprint of it in his head, assuming all the pieces are there. If pieces are missing, it is less likely to work, but it isn't impossible.</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Engineering (Software)</h1>
          <p>Editing the programming of androids and creating software that can be used by most kinds of androids. He mostly programs inside his own head.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Reality Filter</b> - <i>A program written by Jakob during his time with his creator</i><br>Basically dissociation. Filters out most of reality, only letting the user perceive the most vital information for survival. Would cause a drop in reaction time for most androids, including himself, due to the processing power needed to decide what is and isn't vital. Theoretically, it would greatly increase reaction time in an android that had the processing power to filter things</li> quicker.
            <li><b>D4UG2.exe</b> - <i>A program written by Jakob during his time with his creator</i><br>Basically drugs. Puts the user in a docile state of relaxation, regardless of the actual stimuli being received. Makes it impossible to focus on reality. Runs on a timer so the user is not required to remember to turn it off.</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Internet Connection</h1>
          <p>Usually turned off to prevent anyone from finding his location. Jakob is capable of wirelessly connecting to any open network.</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Equipment</div>
          <h1>Toolbelt</h1>
          <p>A toolbelt Jakob wears whenever he leaves his workshop. It contains various general repair tools that he may need if he finds an injured android on the street.</p>
          <h1>Hidden Blades</h1>
          <p>A modification that Jakob made to his arms to hide long, thin knives in the casing. They blend into his arm and are covered by his artificial skin, and he can flick them out into his hands easily.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>(<i>Pre-game</i>)</p>
              <p>Trapped in his creator’s college dorm room, JB-KL spends his time in agony or solitude. He undergoes various ‘stress tests’ set up by his creator, physically and mentally, in order to determine at what point an android deviates. At the same time, his creator often builds more barriers to deviation in an attempt to ‘cure’ the problem, and thus amass fame and fortune for himself.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Jakob lives in terror, all the time. But the fear he feels is muted by necessity - he can't allow himself to feel it, or he would be completely unable to function. His stress levels have almost driven him to self-destruct multiple times, but through use of his own self-made programs (essentially self-medicating), he is able to keep himself from tipping over the edge.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>(<i>Any point in the timeline</i>)</p>
              <p>Unable to escape, JB-KL was broken again and again. Eventually, his creator managed to finish his experiment: the deviancy anti-virus was complete. It is currently unreleased, but fully installed in JB-KL in order to test it.</p>
              <p>JB-KL is now allowed outdoors, since his creator has no fears that he will deviate ever again. He usually runs errands for his creator, of both the legal and illegal variants.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>The main word to describe Jakob is empty. As a form of self-defense, he has retreated into the role of an 'empty machine', causing his creator to declare the anti-deviancy program a success. Jakob refuses to deviate out of fear of being hurt again. However, despite retreating far into himself, Jakob is not <i>gone</i>. Occasionally, he will give mercy despite knowing his creator wouldn't want him to, or resist in small ways that aren't <i>technically</i> disobeying.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>(<i>Near the start of game</i>)</p>
              <p>Currently living at his workshop in Detroit and working for the DPD as a mechanic and consultant regarding android maintenance. He is not qualified to carry a weapon, pursue or question suspects, or make arrests.</p>
              <p>His status as an android is a secret, and he had removed his LED to keep it that way. Most of his coworkers are not aware.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>By working in an area with other people, Jakob is constantly forced out of his comfort zone when it comes to interacting with other people. But he often finds it isn't nearly as bad as he thinks it will be. Because he is pushed, but still has a stable position with his job and place in life, he is slowly starting to trust people just a little more. He still doesn't let them close, most of the time, but he is working on lowering his walls and building a support system. That positive growth has allowed him to start to work on recovering from his trauma regarding his creator.</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Abilities</div>
          <h1>Engineering (Hardware)</h1>
          <p>A capable engineer, both in large mechanical items and smaller electronics. He genuinely enjoys tinkering with things, and is almost never seen without something in his hands. He doesn't like to think about it, but it is a skill he inherited from his creator.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Virtual Blueprints</b><br>Looking at an item (even a broken one) allows him to construct a full blueprint of it in his head, assuming all the pieces are there. If pieces are missing, it is less likely to work, but it isn't impossible.</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Engineering (Software)</h1>
          <p>Editing the programming of androids and creating software that can be used by most kinds of androids. He mostly programs inside his own head.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Reality Filter</b> - <i>A program written by Jakob during his time with his creator</i><br>Basically dissociation. Filters out most of reality, only letting the user perceive the most vital information for survival. Would cause a drop in reaction time for most androids, including himself, due to the processing power needed to decide what is and isn't vital. Theoretically, it would greatly increase reaction time in an android that had the processing power to filter things</li> quicker.
            <li><b>D4UG2.exe</b> - <i>A program written by Jakob during his time with his creator</i><br>Basically drugs. Puts the user in a docile state of relaxation, regardless of the actual stimuli being received. Makes it impossible to focus on reality. Runs on a timer so the user is not required to remember to turn it off.</li>
          </ul>
          <h1>Internet Connection</h1>
          <p>Usually turned off to prevent anyone from finding his location. Jakob is capable of wirelessly connecting to any open network.</p>

          <div class="bio-title">Equipment</div>
          <h1>Toolbelt</h1>
          <p>A toolbelt Jakob wears whenever he leaves his workshop. It contains various general repair tools that he may need if he finds an injured android on the street.</p>
          <h1>Hidden Blades</h1>
          <p>A modification that Jakob made to his arms to hide long, thin knives in the casing. They blend into his arm and are covered by his artificial skin, and he can flick them out into his hands easily.</p>
          <h1>DPD ID</h1>
          <p>An ID that proves he works at the DPD as a mechanic and consultant on cases that involve the death of androids. It allows him after-hours access to the precinct.</p>

              <h1>AU Description</h1>
              <p>(<i>Any point in the timeline</i>)</p>
              <p>Thinking economically, it only made sense for Jakob’s creator to use a child model for his experiments. It was smaller, and thus easier to hide. Besides, the younger mind was easier to stress, and it was less likely to escape.</p>
              <p>Fortunately, Jakob did manage to escape from his creator. He lives on the streets, avoiding contact with most people unless necessary. However, he does spend a lot of time at a hobby shop. The owner of the shop suspects that he is an android, but doesn’t ask questions. Instead, he just shares his lunch with Jakob (in case he really is a human that needs food to live) and puts on old detective anime in the back room for him to watch.</p>
              <hr>
              <h1>Personality</h1>
              <p>Jakob is a delicate mix of cautious and curious, unable to keep himself from getting into trouble. He does his best to stay safe whenever trouble erupts around him, though, and often gets terrified of the situations that he stumbles into. He finds it hard to trust anyone, especially adults, but secretly longs for some sort of connection and someone to protect him.</p>

          <h1>Virtual Blueprints</h1>
          <p>Looking at an item (even a broken one) allows him to construct a full blueprint of it in his head, assuming all the pieces are there. If pieces are missing, it is less likely to work, but it isn't impossible.</p>
          <h1>Engineering (Software)</h1>
          <p>Editing the programming of androids and creating software that can be used by most kinds of androids. He only programs inside his own head.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Reality Filter</b> - <i>A program written by Jakob during his time with his creator</i><br>Basically dissociation. Filters out most of reality, only letting the user perceive the most vital information for survival. Would cause a drop in reaction time for most androids, including himself, due to the processing power needed to decide what is and isn't vital. Theoretically, it would greatly increase reaction time in an android that had the processing power to filter things</li> quicker.
          </ul>
          <h1>Internet Connection</h1>
          <p>Usually turned off to prevent anyone from finding his location. Jakob is capable of wirelessly connecting to any open network.</p>
